	Annote = {We define clientelism as a particular mode of ``exchange'' between elec-
toral constituencies as principals and politicians as agents in democratic
systems. This exchange is focused on particular classes of goods, though
the feasibility and persistence of clientelistic reciprocity is not determined
by the type of goods exchanged.


. raises the obvious threat of opportunistic
defection, in which either the voter or the politician reneges on the deal
once he or she has been ``paid.''


.Furthermore, the effectiveness of clientelistic targeting increases with the precision of monitoring constituency behavior and enforcing compliance by sanctioning free-riding, even though
these may be expensive undertakings. 


. We define party systems as competitive when citizens and politicians have strong incentives to try hard to win supporters at the margin for one or the
other partisan camp.


. principal--agent accountability
. Local or small-scale public goods
allow the ruling party to employ geographic targeting according to the
landscape of political units as in Diaz-Cayeros, Magaloni, and Weingast
(2002).


. This is the reason why we believe public goods are always riskier than private outlays.


. For a discussion of clientelism as supply and demand based, see Shefter, Martin (1994), and Piattoni (2001).


. We believe, however, that public jobs are only one of many possible instruments that politicians use to deal with this problem. In the analysis that follows, we implicitly assume that the more a party can target transfers, the better it can solve the commitment
problem.


. Yo: organizational capabilities: size have an incidence in how difficult is for people to organize and reject the incumbent. 


. Private transfers can be extremely expensive due to the transaction costs that must be overcome for effective targeting and to the amount of vote-buying needed to ensure election victories. 


. In contrast, public goods reduce transaction costs and
aremore cost-effective per beneficiary. But they aremuch riskier than pri-
vate goods. 


. CLIENTELISM IN ADVANCED DEMOCRACIES: 

- The crisis of clientelism involves the unraveling of both of these features, namely of (1) the politicized public and semi-public economy, and (2) the dominance of Christian (or Liberal Democrat) center-right parties.

- It is not coordinated market capitalism per se, but specific arrangements of sectoral and firm--group centered versions of that coordinated capitalism, often intertwined with outright state-run companies or regulatory agencies, that set the stage for direct exchange relations of electoral constituencies with office-seeking politicians deliv- ering particularistic, targeted groups to relevant audiences.

- WHY CLIENTELISM DIED? Three mechanisms drove the crisis of clientelism: (1) the declining performance of clientelistically penetrated economic sectors, resulting in skyrocketing demands for subsidies; and (2) an intensification of democratic political competition over linkage mechanisms in which the defenders of clientelism increasingly fought rearguard battles. (3) Once there was a receptive audience to challenge established modes of citizen-politician accountability, the mass media served as catalysts to broadcast and amplify political discontent with democracy.

- The industries involved in clientelistic politics have been on the relative and absolute decline since the 1970s.

Kitchelt: criticizes the idea of "clientelism is dead b/c its costs has rised". 

- This brings me to my fourth and final point. Both the rise and
the demise of clientelism in advanced capitalist democracies is deeply enmeshed in the reorganization of political-economic governance more generally and of the parties involved in this process more specifically WHAT THAT DOES MEAN?!

(1) Gosnell (1968: 100--03), Lowi (1964), Callow (1976: 91--138), Erie (1988), and Shefter (1994); see Finegold (1995) for a qualification of this argument.

(2) On the demand side, clientelism generally is associated with low levels
of socioeconomic development and organization of the civil society, that is few and weakly autonomous (not party controlled) societal organiza- tions (see e.g., Banfield 1958).},
