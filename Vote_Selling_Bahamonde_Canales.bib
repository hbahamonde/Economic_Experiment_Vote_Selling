We define party systems as competitive when citizens and politicians have strong incentives to try hard to win supporters at the margin for one or the other partisan camp. . principal--agent accountability . Local or small-scale public goods allow the ruling party to employ geographic targeting according to the landscape of political units as in Diaz-Cayeros, Magaloni, and Weingast (2002). . This is the reason why we believe public goods are always riskier than private outlays. . For a discussion of clientelism as supply and demand based, see Shefter, Martin (1994), and Piattoni (2001). . We believe, however, that public jobs are only one of many possible instruments that politicians use to deal with this problem. In the analysis that follows, we implicitly assume that the more a party can target transfers, the better it can solve the commitment problem. . Yo: organizational capabilities: size have an incidence in how difficult is for people to organize and reject the incumbent. . Private transfers can be extremely expensive due to the transaction costs that must be overcome for effective targeting and to the amount of vote-buying needed to ensure election victories. . In contrast, public goods reduce transaction costs and aremore cost-effective per beneficiary. But they aremuch riskier than pri- vate goods. .},

This method of contingent exchange thrives in both autocracies and democracies. It exists in a large variety of cultural contexts. Confronted with economic develop- ment, clientelism fades away in some political contexts but adapts and survives in others. This article explores our understanding of the ori- gins and dynamics of clientelism, focusing on the relationships between clientelism and democracy and between clientelism and development. It then evaluates the connection between clientelism and a variety of political and economic outcomes, including democratic accountability, corruption, and public goods provision. It concludes by outlining some remaining empirical and theoretical challenges and highlighting recent innovations in data collection and empirical methods.},

@article{Hicken2020,
	abstract = {Research on clientelism often starts from a shared puzzle: How can clientelism be a viable electoral strategy if voters can renege on their commitments to politicians? The standard solution proposed is that politicians resolve this commitment problem with voters through monitoring and enforcement. But there has been startlingly little evidence of individual-level monitoring and enforcement in the recent literature, and many studies now document the use of clientelism even where politicians are aware that the commitment problem remains completely intractable. When read together, recent studies suggest that the focus on resolving the commitment problem is a red herring. Instead, it is increasingly clear that clientelism does not need to be monitored and that the commitment problem does not bind as politicians choose their electoral appeals. New puzzles, motivated by advances in the recent literature, deserve comparatively more attention in future research.},

	abstract = {Within this article, we aim at exploring the topic of clientelism in Cameroon as a species of a wider phenomenon affecting Central and Western Francophone Africa. Our argument is that, in spite of the repeated efforts of reinforcing the local power structures, we have witnessed a process of centralisation of clientelism: the new networks are shaped around the `Creatures', who are the President Paul Biya's formal or informal appointees and play the role of nodal elements relying the rest of the chain to the central command. This happened on the expenses of the locally dispersed and more autonomous clientelistic groups that were either included in or smashed by the pyramidal Creatures' structured. In order to test our assumption, we analysed a specific body of literature on the theorization of clientelism and on its African and Cameroonian specificity and organized four focus groups with the actual and former members of the clientelistic chains at different levels (central, regional and local). If our main presupposition proved to be generally correct, one of the sub-arguments was only partially validated through this empirical component of our research.},

A principal feature of prospect theory is that it posits that individuals' risk tendency varies across contexts, with individuals being risk averse in the domain of gains and risk accepting in the domain of losses.This means that the propensity to take risks is thus not a stable personality trait, with some individuals being prone to take risks while others always steer away from them Individuals use a reference point, usually the status quo, to establish whether they find themselves in a situation or domain of losses or of gains. Losses weigh typically two to two and a half times more heavily than gains. losing twenty dollars hurts more than finding twenty dollars pleases. Since prospect theory is developed as a theory of individual decision making, the question is whether it is applicable to collective decision making.3 In many studies of political behaviour, the aggregation problem is not circumventable because collective decision making is what matters. But is it a problem? There is a substantial body of experimental and empirical evidence -- in a variety of (sub-)disciplines that political scientists typically do not refer to -- suggesting that this problem is smaller than it may seem. Experimental evidence indicates that pairs of individuals violate the predictions of expected utility theory in the same manner as do individuals (Bone et al., 1999; see Kameda and Davis, 1990). Comparative Politics (CP) [has] been particularly slow on incorporating prospect theory in [its] work},

	abstract = {When do governments pursue unpopular reform, such as cutting benefits? And when do they engage in not-unpopular reform, such as activation? Current approaches in welfare state research cannot systematically explain the cross-government variation in the two types of reform. Based on insights from prospect theory, a psychological theory of choice under risk, this article complements existing theories by arguing that losses and gains matter crucially for welfare state reform. A fs/QCA analysis of labour market reforms pursued by 23 Danish, German, Dutch and British Cabinets between 1979 and 2005 corroborates this hypothesis. Specifically, it shows that an improving political position (a gain) is the necessary condition for not-unpopular reform while for unpopular reform it is a deteriorating socio-economic situation (a loss). This finding helps account for the puzzling cross-government variation in different types of welfare state reform.},

We use a temporary grant program that is uniquely suitable for testing theories of vote-purchasing behavior of incumbent governments. The temporary grant program differs from traditional intergovernmental grants in several aspects, most importantly in the sovereign decision-making power given to the incumbent central government. We find support for the hypothesis that the incumbent government used the grant program under study to win votes. In particular, we find strong support for the Lindbeck--Weibull/Dixit--Londregan model, in which parties distribute transfers to regions where there are many swing voters. This result is statistically as well as economically significant. We do not, however, find any support for the model that predicts that the incumbent government transfers money to its own supporters.},

Decision problems can be described or framed in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an option can depend on whether a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss.

I present a model of vote buying in which a broker sustains bribed voters' compliance by conditioning future bribes on whether her candidate's votes reach an optimally set threshold. Unlike previous explanations of compliance, the threshold mechanism does not require brokers to observe individual voters' political preferences or even vote totals of the bribed voters. I show that when there is uncertainty about voters' preferences, compliance can be sustained as long as electoral results of small groups are available. If preferences are observed however, vote buying is not deterred by higher aggregation of electoral results. I also find that vote buying is facilitated when voters care about the welfare of other voters. Using survey data from Nigeria, I provide evidence consistent with the model's results.},

Equilibrium is unique in the present model, and a sufficient condition for existence is given, requiring that there be enough 'stochastic heterogeneity' with respect to party preferences in the electorate. The validity of Hotelling's 'principle of minimum differentiation', and of 'Director's Law', are examined under alternative hypotheses concerning administrative costs of redistributions, and voter's possibilities both of abstaining from voting and of becoming campaign activists for one of the parties. The policy strategy of expected-plurality maximization is contrasted with the strategy of maximizing the probability of gaining a plurality.

While poverty is a key predictor of clientelism, some urban poor voters are more involved in clientelistic arrangements than others. Insecure tenure, lack of access to public resources, and location in areas exposed to environmental shocks increase the vulnerability of slum dwellers. This vulnerability is used by politicians and brokers, who politicize access to scarce resources, and thus make slum dweller more exposed to clientelism. The qualitative literature has long highlighted how clientelism provides a strategy for slum dwellers to cope with their vulnerability, but this population is often excluded from quantitative analyses of clientelism. Using survey data from Argentina and a matching technique that allows us to compare slum dwellers with similar non-slum dwellers, we find that there is indeed a higher prevalence of clientelism among the former. We use a survey experiment on monitoring and sanctions to show that this different exposure to clientelism is consequential. We find different responses across similarly poor slum dwellers and non-slum dwellers regarding the potential consequences of defecting from clientelistic arrangements. Our findings suggest that including slum dwellers in quantitative analyses would improve our understanding of clientelism.},

	abstract = {Studies of clientelism typically assume that political machines deliver rewards to influence vote choices and turnout of the existing electorate. This assumption masks important clientelist strategies because it focuses narrowly on citizens who are already registered in a machine's district. Political machines distribute benefits not only to influence the actions of the electorate, but also to shape the composition of the electorate. One such clientelist strategy, which we term ``voter buying,'' induces citizens in other districts to transfer their electoral registration and vote for the machine. A formal model suggests that voter buying is incentive-compatible and provides several testable predictions. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses provide evidence of this strategy in Brazil. We investigate the impact of voter buying with a regression discontinuity design, exploiting an intervention that required municipalities to re-register their entire electorate if they exceed an arbitrary threshold. This intervention undermined voter buying and reduced the likelihood of mayoral reelection by 18 percentage points. Consistent with the voter-buying model, the treatment effect of the intervention is over twice as large (41 percentage points) if many voters recently transferred away from neighboring municipalities.},

In an ideal system, premiums depend only on the total damage in a given state, not on its distribution over individuals. In particular, mitigation measures are optimally induced. The differences between the ideal model of insurance and the real world are described, and some explanations offered. {\textcopyright} 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

We also vary the relative importance of the second preferred option. Quantal response equilibrium analysis is used to analyze the game and derive predictions. Our results indeed show that strategic voting arises. Its extent depends on (i) information availability; (ii) the relative importance of the intermediate candidate; (iii) the electorate's relative support for one's preferred candidate; (iv) the relative position of the plurality-supported candidate in one's preference ordering. Our results show that information serves as a coordination device where strategic voting does not harm the plurality-preferred candidate's chances of winning.},

@article{Barberis2013,
	abstract = {In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, published a paper in Econometrica titled ``Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk.'' The paper presented a new model of risk attitudes called ``prospect theory,'' which elegantly captured the experimental evidence on risk taking, including the documented violations of expected utility. More than 30 years later, prospect theory is still widely viewed as the best available description of how people evaluate risk in experimental settings. However, there are still relatively few well-known and broadly accepted applications of prospect theory in economics. One might be tempted to conclude that, even if prospect theory is an excellent description of behavior in experimental settings, it is less relevant outside the laboratory. In my view, this lesson would be incorrect. Over the past decade, researchers in the field of behavioral economics have put a lot of thought into how prospect theory should be applied in economic settings. This effort is bearing fruit. A significant body of theoretical work now incorporates the ideas in prospect theory into more traditional models of economic behavior, and a growing body of empirical work tests the predictions of these new theories. I am optimistic that some insights of prospect theory will eventually find a permanent and significant place in mainstream economic analysis.},

	abstract = {What explains the wide variation across countries in the use of vote buying and policy promises during election campaigns? We address this question, and account for a number of stylized facts and apparent anomalies regarding vote buying, using a model in which parties cannot fully commit to campaign promises. We find that high vote buying is associated with frequent reneging on campaign promises, strong electoral competition, and high policy rents. Frequent reneging and low party competence reduce campaign promises. If vote buying can be financed out of public resources, incumbents buy more votes and enjoy an electoral advantage, but they also promise more public goods. Vote buying has distributional consequences: voters targeted with vote buying pre-election may receive no government benefits post-election. The results point to obstacles to the democratic transition from clientelist to programmatic forms of electoral competition: parties may not benefit electorally from institutions that increase commitment.},

In recent years, however, the literature has begun to call this premise into question, due to several changes in the Chilean political landscape: the current crisis of representation, the high programmatic congruence between the two main coalitions, the decline in the political relevance of the dictatorship, and the rise of nonprogrammatic electoral strategies. In addition to these transformations, Chile switched to voluntary voting in 2012. This article studies whether ideology still informs electoral choices in Chile in an era of voluntary voting. It implements a conjoint survey experiment in low-to-middle-income neighborhoods in Santiago, where voters would be expected to be less ideological. It shows that candidates' ideological labels are crucial for understanding the electoral decisions of a large part of the sample, particularly among likely voters.},

	annote = {when applied to political behavior, prospect theory places a crucial emphasis on the role of the political environment in helping to determine choice and action Prospect theory offers a number of advantages that justify the use of psy- chological models over alternative models of political behavior: (1) It provides an alternative model to rational choice and other theories, one that is founded on empirical data. (2) It allows for an explanation of dynamic change within the model itself. (3) It asks different kinds of questions and seeks different kinds of evidence than other models, thus illuminating previously ignored aspects of deci- sion problems. (4) It focuses on the importance of the situation in decision- making. (5) Along with other experimentally based models, it presents a micro-foundational basis for the explanation of larger phenomena of interest. (6) It emphasizes the importance of loss in calculations of value and utility. (7) It focuses attention on the context of a situation, which helps illuminate other impor- tant areas of research, including framing, uncertainty, accountability, escalation and commitment, sunk costs, and momentum effects. (8) It encourages specific attention to the importance of value, how it changes over time, and the critical nature of value trade-offs in a way that is intuitively significant but is often theoretically ignored in other models. Within this framework, Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 1984) showed that most individuals remain more cautious in the so-called domain of gains while making riskier decisions in a domain of loss. In mathematical representations constitute the central tenets of prospect theory Nonetheless, relative to other models of decision-making in political science, prospect theory does not depend on assumptions of individual behavior that are rooted in economic models that presume that individual actors naturally incorpo- rate invariance, dominance, and transitivity into their decision-making. Rather, prospect theory develops its assumptions empirically, through experimentation In particular, as the domain shifts from one of gains to one of losses, prospect theory would predict that individual risk propensity would become more risk-taking. But prospect theory is not a traditional personality theory; that is, an analyst need not know much about the individual character or history of a particular leader in order to explain or predict behavior. More important, prospect theory sheds light on the interaction between the person and the situation in decision-making environments. The situation in a large sense determines the domain of action. Specifically, the idea is that leaders in a good situation, or a domain of gains, where things are going well and are expected to continue to do well or improve, are more likely to be cautious in their choices. On the other hand, leaders in a bad situation, where things are bad or likely to get worse, are more likely to make risky choices to recover their losses. endowment effect, whereby individuals attach added personal value to the things they have, Next, work intent on expanding the mathematical formulation of prospect theory beyond individuals to group or dyadic interaction would constitute an enor- mous advance. {\#}{\#} Such a formulation might then be used to test prospect theory models against game theoretic models, using either large data sets or individual case studies. This attention to losses speaks to a wide variety of literature in political science. Debates about relative versus absolute gains can be informed by this finding concerning loss aversion. Relative gains may seem more important than absolute gains because they establish a relationship of dominance between one person and another: One has more, the other less. In addition, having less also encourages greater risk-taking patterns of behavior. And having more is easily accepted, whereas having less spurs action to get more. Indeed, relative amounts of sunk costs (as opposed to absolute amounts) have a significant influence on subjects' likelihood of escalating commitment and funding for future courses of action (Garland {\&} Newport, 1991). {\#} Second, people's value structures are understood to shift over time. {\#}{\#} Current models of prospect theory lack the ability to confront game theoretic models on their own grounds because of their inability to deal with strategic inter- action and aggregation of choice across individuals. {\#} This work can be done mathematically and experimentally but will be extremely complex. Once this is accomplished, however, more direct comparisons between game theoretic rational choice models and prospect theory can be conducted on a larger scale, {\#} First, as noted above, work that attempts to expand the applicability of prospect theory to dyadic and group interactions will constitute an enormous con- tribution to the field},

We provide a theoretical framework and formal model to explain how and why machines mix four clientelist strategies during elections: vote buying, turnout buying, abstention buying, and double persuasion. Machines tailor their portfolios to the political preferences and voting costs of the electorate. They also adapt their mix to at least five contextual factors: compulsory voting, ballot secrecy, political salience, machine support, and political polarization. Our analysis yields numerous insights, such as why the introduction of compulsory voting may increase vote buying, and why enhanced ballot secrecy may increase turnout buying and abstention buying. Evidence from various countries is consistent with our predictions and suggests the need for empirical studies to pay closer attention to the ways in which machines combine clientelist strategies.},

If, at different stages of this relationship, both the patron and the client have incentives to defect and not honor informal agreements, what makes clientelism self-enforcing? The following paper presents a game-theoretical model of political clientelism in which a candidate disciplines a majority of voters through the promise of a future flow of benefits. A mixed strategy involving a randomized allocation of resources among constituencies makes clientelism feasible when the politician's action is contingent on the result of the election. Higher campaign budgets and lower voter aversion towards clientelistic parties, as well as higher patience and higher heterogeneity across groups of voters, make clientelism more likely. Swing voters tend to be gifted more frequently than core supporters with this frequency increasing as group heterogeneity increases, presenting a positive association.},

@article{Mercer2005,
	abstract = {Prospect theory is the most influential behavioral theory of choice in the social sciences. Its creators won a Nobel Prize in economics, and it is largely responsible for the booming field of behavioral economics. Although international relations theorists who study security have used prospect theory extensively, Americanists, comparativists, and political economists have shown little interest in it. The dominant explanation for political scientists' tepid response focuses on the theoretical problems with extending a theory devised in the lab to explain political decisions in the field. This essay focuses on these problems and reviews suggested solutions. It suggests that prospect theory's failure to ignite the imagination of more political scientists probably results from their aversion to behavioral assumptions and not from problems unique to prospect theory.

@book{McDermott1998,
	abstract = {This dissertation investigates risk propensity in the international environment. Insights derived from a psychological, descriptive theory of choice are used to illuminate some of the conditions under which decisionmakers are more or less likely to engage in risky behavior. This work is grounded on psychological experimentation conducted by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. Their theory, Prospect Theory, offers many provocative findings concerning the psychological relationships between perceived gains and losses and relative risk propensity. In short, Prospect Theory predicts that people are more likely to take risks in bad situations and more likely to be cautious in good times. This fascinating theory has been well-documented in highly controlled paper and pencil tests. The question in the present inquiry is whether or not these relationships hold for state behavior in the international environment. This dissertation reviews the existing literature on risk in Political Science. Prospect Theory is examined in substance; some of the methodological and operational considerations involved in the case work is discussed. Four cases in postwar American foreign policy are examined in detail. The first two cases investigate President Carter. The Iranian rescue mission is the decision made in the domain of losses. The decision not to let the shah into the United States after his departure from Iran constitutes the decision made in the domain of gains. The next two cases concern decisions made by President Eisenhower. The first discusses the Soviet downing of the U-2, a set of decisions made in a domain of losses. The following case analyzes the Suez crisis, a choice made in the domain of gains. The contribution of this dissertation is two-fold. First, this theory has not been previously applied to real world historical decisions in any systematic way. The four case studies presented in this dissertation do so. Secondly, Prospect Theory argues that real world decisions are affected by the situation in which they take place. It also informs Political Science of the importance of domain in understanding the nature of risk-taking behavior. Thus, this dissertation asserts the importance of the decisionmaking level of analysis.},

Political theories of agenda setting and policy choice are still limited in predicting when an issue will become salient and, once it has, what policy option will be used to address it. This article illustrates that for a large class of externality problems, perspectives from three other social science disciplines can refine those predictions. Methods. A synthesis of implications from economics on assignment of property rights, loss aversion from prospect theory, and image of the policy target from social construction is used to determine the conditions under which issues gain attention and the likely policy solutions. Results. Assignment of property rights establishes a baseline used to assess any further government actions, with losses from that base more likely to generate political attention. The assignment of rights also determines if a problem is defined as a negative or positive externality, which restricts the type of policies used to address the problem. This initial allocation of rights is in turn affected both by the political power and social construction of the groups involved. Conclusions. The result is a bias in policy attention and outcomes strongly influenced by the norms used in assignment of property rights, which typically favor those generating the negative externality. {\textcopyright} 2006 Southwestern Social Science Association.},

Moreover, performing nonclientelistic roles prepares brokers to perform clientelistic strategies. The article also presents a novel theoretical account for why voters abide by the clientelistic deal.

The wines have greatly appreciated in value, so that a bottle that cost only {\$}10 when purchased would now fetch {\$}200 at auction. This economist now drinks some of this wine occasionally, but would neither be willing to sell the wine at the auction price nor buy an additional bottle at that price. Thaler (1980) called this pattern---the fact that people often demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it---the endowment effect. The example also illustrates what Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) call a status quo bias, a preference for the current state that biases the economist against both buying and selling his wine. These anomalies are a manifestation of an asymmetry of value that Kahneman and Tversky (1984) call loss aversion---the disutility of giving up an object is greater that the utility associated with acquiring it. This column documents the evidence supporting endowment effects and status quo biases, and discusses their relation to loss aversion.},

Matters related to the stability of divergent electoral coalitions have rarely been addressed. We explicitly take into account how differential rates of support by various groups in a constituency will influence candidates' campaign promises and the likelihood that stable electoral coalitions will be forged. Viewing campaign platforms as promised redistributions of welfare, we argue that the optimal strategy for risk-averse candidates will be to promise redistributions first and foremost to their reelection constituency and thereby to maintain existing political coalitions. We use evidence from the urban services literature to support our propositions. {\textcopyright} 1986, Southern Political Science Association. All rights reserved.},

We assume that a person's reference point is her rational expectations held in the recent past about outcomes, which are determined in a personal equilibrium by the requirement that they must be consistent with optimal behavior given expec- tations. In deterministic environments, choices maximize consumption utility, but gain--loss utility influences behavior when there is uncertainty. Applying the model to consumer behavior, we show that willingness to pay for a good is increasing in the expected probability of purchase and in the expected prices conditional on purchase. In within-day labor-supply decisions, a worker is less likely to continue work if income earned thus far is unexpectedly high, but more likely to show up as well as continue work if expected income is high},

In this article, we use data on community radio license applications in Brazil to identify both the causal effect of incumbency on politicians' ability to control the media and the causal effect of media control on their future electoral prospects. Using a regression discontinuity design, we compare city council candidates who barely won or barely lost an election, showing that incumbency more than doubles the probability of an application's approval by the Ministry of Communications. Next, using genetic matching, we compare candidates who acquired community radio licenses before an election to similar politicians who did not, showing that a radio station substantially increases one's vote share and probability of victory. These findings demonstrate that media control helps entrench local political power in Brazil. {\textcopyright} 2011, Midwest Political Science Association.},

	abstract = {Political machines use state resources to win elections in many developing democracies and electoral autocracies. Recent research has noted that the coordination of machine politics can be much more complex and problem-prone than previously thought. Yet, the role that the subnational political context plays in solving these coordination problems has largely been neglected in the comparative literature. This article seeks to fill this gap and suggests that control over the local administration is an important variable that shapes the effectiveness of authoritarian machine politics. We exploit the great institutional and political variation within one of the most prominent electoral authoritarian regimes of today, the Russian Federation, to test the empirical implications of the theory with detailed local level electoral and socio-economic data as well as multilevel regression models. The empirical results highlight the importance of subnational political structures in supporting electoral authoritarian regimes.},

Existing theories predict that (1) it has no effect, (2) opposition parties change more, (3) opposition parties change more after several spells in opposition, and (4) parties' responses vary because of different goal orientations. We propose that a party's aspiration to office, measured by its historical success or failure in entering office, determines a party's reaction to being in opposition or government. We hypothesize that, because of loss aversion, parties with low office aspiration change more when they are in government than when they are in opposition. Conversely, parties with high office aspiration change more as opposition party than as government party. We find evidence for these hypotheses through a pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis of 1,686 platform changes in 21 democracies, using the Comparative Manifesto Data and an innovative measure of party platform change.},

	abstract = {We argue that governing status affects how voters react to extreme versus moderate policy positions. Being in government forces parties to compromise and to accept ideologically unappealing choices as the best among available alternatives. Steady exposure to government parties in this role and frequent policy compromise by governing parties lead voters to discount the positions of parties when they are in government. Hence, government parties do better in elections when they offset this discounting by taking relatively extreme positions. The relative absence of this discounting dynamic for opposition parties, on the other hand, means that they perform better by taking more moderate positions, as the standard Downsian model would predict. We present evidence from national elections in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, 1971-2005, to support this claim. {\textcopyright} 2012, Midwest Political Science Association.},

Using Gerring's (Polity 31:357-393, 1999) characterization of a "good" concept, I establish the core attributes of clientelism, which, in addition to being an interest-maximizing exchange, involves longevity, diffuseness, face-to-face contact, and inequality. Using secondary sources and fieldwork data, I differentiate clientelism from concepts such as vote-buying and corruption and determine its analytical position at the microsociological level. I argue that labeling sociopolitical systems as clientelistic is awkward since, operating at a higher analytical level, they have characteristics beyond microsociological clientelism and they affect the political nature of the clientelism they contain. I conclude that differentiating clientelism by confining it to the microsociological level will aid theory-building. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Drawing on important lessons from prospect theory, I argue that citizens who were in the domain of economic losses were more likely to take a risk and vote in favor of Brexit. On the contrary, I hold that citizens who were in the domain of economic gains tended to be more risk averse and were more likely to support `Remain' in the referendum. Using data from several waves of the British Election Study 2014--2019 Internet Panel, I find strong support for these theoretical expectations. British voters who lived in declining areas were significantly more likely to think that leaving the EU would lead to improvements in the national economy. These prospective economic evaluations (captured about a month prior to the referendum) in turn are related to the `Leave' vote in the Brexit referendum.},

Kurt Weyland examines, in particular, the surprising willingness of presidents in four Latin American countries to enact daring reforms and the unexpected resultant popular support. He argues that only with the robust cognitive-psychological insights of prospect theory can one fully account for the twists and turns of politics and economic policy in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela during the 1980s and 1990s. Assessing conventional approaches such as rational choice, Weyland concludes that prospect theory is vital to any systematic attempt to understand the politics of market reform.

Since it is based on a rational maximizing model it describes how consumers should choose, but it is alleged to also describe how they do choose.

In these situations economic theory will make systematic errors in predicting behavior. Kanneman and Tversey's prospect theory is proposed as the basis for an alternative descriptive theory.
