\section{Parties With a Gambling Problem: Vote Buying as a Risky Yet Persistent Strategy}

% Vote buying is a risky strategy, why
Vote buying is a very risky strategy.\footnote{\textcite{Gans-Morse2013} explain that clientelist parties utilize a mix of four clientelist strategies during elections (vote buying, turnout buying, abstention buying, and double persuasion). In this paper we concentrate on vote buying which is defined as the distribution of rewards during elections in contingent exchange for vote choices \parencite[316]{Nichter2014}.} First, it is illegal.\footnote{\textcite{Bahamonde2020a} explains that in the United States, vote buying was illegal as early as the 1700s.} Buying votes requires extra care to avoid reputational, electoral, and legal costs. For instance, due to the stigma associated with vote buying, clientelist political parties might risk electoral support from the wealthy  \parencite{Weitz-shapiro} or from society in general \parencite{GonzalezOcantos2014}. Second, vote choices are secret, thus preventing parties from conducting effective monitoring and enforcement \parencite{Nichter2008}. Even in developing contexts such as Africa \parencite{Wantchekon2003,Vicente2014}, the Philippines \parencite{Hicken2015,Hicken2018} and Latin America \parencite{Hidalgo2012,Oliveros2019,Murillo2021a}, voters might accept the private benefit but then secretly vote for another party \parencite{Stokes2005,Nichter2008,Szwarcberg2013,GonzalezOcantos2014,Vicente2014}, rendering the risks taken by the clientelist party worthless.\footnote{In fact, since clientelism may also work even with low levels of enforcement and monitoring \parencite{Hicken2020}, investments in clientelism are always done in contexts of very high risk.}

% Yet, despite these risks, vote buying is very common.
If vote buying is risky \parencite[43]{Szwarcberg2013}, expensive \parencite[35]{Zarazaga2014}, and uncertain \parencite[164]{Rueda2016}, how do clientelist political parties allocate scarce resources efficiently? In this paper, we address two related but more specific questions about strategic vote buying related to the role of political contestation and sunk costs. First, \emph{How risk-tolerant are parties when facing contested elections?} Second, \emph{Do clientelist political parties consider ``yesterday's'' spending levels when buying votes ``today''?}  These are important questions, as they directly speak about a party's decision-making process when faced with risk. Unfortunately, we find that some of the literature provides conflicting answers to some of these questions. This paper posits that a number of these gaps originate in a misunderstanding about a party's decision-making processes under risk.

% prior levels of economic losses. 

% abstract 1
Traditional theories of clientelism assert that vote buying is more likely when parties are losing elections, while ignoring prior spending levels on vote buying. We consider this framework is limited in a number of ways. First, it assumes that losses and gains affect party's decision-making process in a comparable way---i.e., winning elections feels just as good as losing one hurts. Second, it assumes that the decision-making process of clientelist political parties focuses only on absolute levels of utility while overlooking changes in outcomes with respect to a reference point---i.e., it does not matter whether clientelist parties have had successes or failures as precedent \parencite{Kahneman1986a,Schumacher2015}. In this paper we contest these assumptions. %In this paper we note that these assumptions do not conform with recent empirical findings. 


% abstract 2
By introducing prospect theory \parencite{Kahneman1979} in the study of clientelism, our argument is twofold. First, clientelist political parties buy more votes when they are winning the election. When parties are in the domain of gains (e.g. in favorable electoral contexts), they tend to over-secure the electoral support they already have. Analytically, the argument proposes a shift from gains to a one focused on losses: while parties like having a larger supporter base, losing voters hurts more than winning voters pleases, putting heavy pressures to invest in vote buying, even in favorable electoral contexts. In fact, we find that the literature provides some empirical support for this argument. For instance, \textcite[205-206]{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012}, who fielded a list experiment in Nicaragua for the 2008 elections, find that while the incumbent party enjoyed 40\% of the electoral support, 24\% of registered voters were offered a clientelist gift in an election that ``[was] not heavily contested.'' Why would a party buy such a \emph{massive} number of votes in a safe and uncontested election? Are parties purposely wasting their resources? Our argument sheds light onto these questions by asserting that parties in the domain of gains find unbearable the idea of potentially losing the massive electoral support they already have. By exploring the concepts of ``endowment effect'' \parencite{Kahneman1990a} and ``loss aversion'' \parencite{Kahneman1991a}, this paper explains that parties will buy more votes when winning the election because prospective losses are weighted substantially more than commensurate gains (i.e. risk aversion respect to losing  electoral support parties already have).\footnote{The relationship between vote buying and the level of risk attained to future electoral outcomes has also been studied in the literature. For instance, \textcite[428]{Rueda2014a} presents a game-theoretical model of vote buying in which a broker sustains bribed voters' compliance by conditioning future bribes. Similarly, \textcite[401]{Gallego2014} develops a formal model of political clientelism in which a candidate disciplines a majority of voters through the promise of a future flow of benefit.} Thus, in scenarios like these, parties take the risky gamble (i.e. vote buying) because it seems safer than the potential costs of losing current electoral endowments.

Second, clientelist political parties buy more votes when their levels of sunk costs are high. Once clientelist political parties are in the domain of losses (i.e. when they are losing the election), risky strategies (such as vote buying) become more attractive for recovering losses in the short run (risk-seeking respect to vote buying). In these cases, ``gambling'' more money on vote buying will seem more attractive because clientelist political parties will feel the need to aggressively compensate for prior losses. Thus, in several respects we stand opposite to traditional explanations of vote buying that argue vote buying should be more common when parties are losing the election. However, in other respects our findings complement past research, but for different reasons: incumbents do not ``gamble'' more on vote buying because of resource availability only, but also because they feel the need to ``break even.''


% abstract 3
Building on traditional theories of clientelism, we first formalized a basic theory of vote buying, and then we tested it by designing an economic experiment. The voting experiment was carefully designed to capture different domains of gains and losses as well as varying reference points. Exploiting these novel experimental data, we show that prospect theory sheds light on several inconsistencies present in the literature. As the statistical analyses suggest, because of risk-aversion in the domain of gains and risk-seeking in the domain of losses, experimental subjects adopt the riskier alternative of buying votes in a way that is unpredicted by standard expected-value calculations.

% contribution
We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, while prospect theory has been influential in political science only among international relations scholars, the theory has not received much attention among political economists nor comparative politics scholars (\cite[2]{Mercer2005}, \cite[338-339]{Vis2011}). We believe this is a serious issue that should be corrected. We intend to bridge this gap by offering an alternative theory of the political economy of vote buying taking prospect theory as a starting point. Second, in this paper we follow \textcite[297]{Levy1992} as we carefully try to not only show that the observed behavior of political agents is consistent with prospect theory but that prospect theory provides a better explanation of vote buying than do traditional descriptions of vote buying. Third, and from a methodological standpoint, we follow \textcite{Aldrich2011,McDermott2002} in that there is a need for implementing experiments aimed to test formal models, and such, we believe that political scientists might benefit from this process to establish empirical validation of formal models \parencite[45]{McDermott2002}. Since the formal model follows traditional theories of clientelism, it is particularly relevant to test the model in an experimental setting. Finally, our paper is especially relevant to the study of democracy and development, where experiments have been described as ``a promising research tool''  \parencite{DeLaO2011}.

% This paper proceeds as follows. 
This paper proceeds as follows. First, we present several gaps present in the vote-buying literature. Second, we explain the basic concepts behind prospect theory, while providing more details about the direct implications for the clientelism and vote-buying literatures. Third, based on a basic formal model of vote buying, we present our experimental design. Fourth, we analyze the experimental data. Fifth, we conclude by readdressing our results and by discussing some of the limitations of our study as well as proposing some future avenues research.


\section{Traditional Theories of Clientelism}

% Importantly, it is commonly assumed that agents obey the maxims of invariance, dominance, and transitivity leading to the maximization of utility (\cite[291]{McDermott2004}, \cite[719]{Quattrone1988}).
%``The expected-utility principle asserts that individuals attempt to maximize expected utility in their choices between risky options: they weight the utilities of individual outcomes by their probabilities and choose the option with the highest weighted sum''  Levy1992a, 173
% ``The expected-utility principle posits that actors try to maximize their expected by weighting the utility of each possible outcome of a given course of action by the probability of its occurrence, summing over all possible outcomes for each strategy, and selecting that strategy with the highest expected utility.'' Levy1997, 88

% basics of EUT
\textcite{Neumann:1947tc} introduced expected utility theory as one of the first theories of decision making under risk \parencite[15]{McDermott1998}. As its core, the theory considers that the value of an outcome is equal to its payoff times its probability, and that agents choose the option with the highest weighted sum (\cite{Quattrone1988}, \cite[173]{Levy1992a}, \cite[88]{Levy1997}, \cite[15]{McDermott1998}). Importantly, it is assumed that the carrier of utilities are levels of assets rather than gains and losses respect to a reference point \parencite{Levy2003}. Since expected utility theory was introduced, a specific set of behavioral assumptions has dominated political science (\cite[87]{Levy1997}, \cite[289]{McDermott2004}).% nd traditional accounts of vote buying have been no exception. 

%It needs to be clarified, however, that the root of the problem is \emph{not} methodological (i.e., the use of game theory) but analytical. 

% In particular, we contest the assumed decision-making process under risk embedded in most traditional accounts of vote buying.
We contest this traditional approach focused on absolute gains by shifting the attention to losses and context-dependent decision-making processes. In particular, we find it limiting that most research on clientelism focuses on absolute levels of wealth, while assuming that whether decision-makers are in a domain of gains or losses should not affect their attitudes toward risk. Thus, we propose to consider prospect theory as an alternative framework to study vote buying, specifically, by incorporating a decision-maker's risk propensity as it shifts in response to changes in the environment \parencite[292]{McDermott2004}. 

 %Since these assumptions have also been integrated in most traditional vote-buying theories, our paper hopefully clarifies some empirical deviations present in the literature. 


This paper suggests that a shift in focus is a valuable exercise because strategic behavior under risk has usually been modeled according to assumptions about expected-value calculations that are  ``unrealistic'' \parencite[124]{Aldrich2011}. Furthermore, a large body of experimental research finds that many behavioral expectations under risk do not comport with the assumptions present in classical decision-making theory (\cite[25]{Battalio1990}, \cite[1]{Mercer2005}). As a matter of fact, Bernoulli---the forefather of expected utility theory \parencite{Schoemaker1982a}---was the first to notice that people would not always behave on the basis of the expected value of a game \parencite[15-16]{McDermott1998}. From a decision-making standpoint, many find that the assumptions underlying the classical theory of risky choice are ``systematically violated'' \parencite[719]{Quattrone1988} and that both variance and semivariance ideas of risk have been shown to be ``inconsistent`` with von Neumann axioms \parencite[1405]{March1987}. Furthermore, there seems to be a strong consensus that standard assumptions about strategic behavior under risk ``continually failed empirically'' \parencite[335]{Vis2011}, while others find that experiments have shown that ``actual behavior and decisions frequently deviate from the neoclassical predictions'' \parencite[167]{Fatas2007}. 

The empirical literature consistently finds that ``people systematically violate the predictions of expected utility theory'' \parencite[173]{Barberis2013}. In fact, \textcite[87]{Levy1997} finds it ``ironic'' that just as rational choice has become the most influential paradigm in political science, the theory has come under heavy attack by experimental and empirical evidence. The problem is that some of these assumptions have also been embedded in most of the vote-buying literature. Thus, while much progress has been made in the understanding of clientelism and vote buying (see \cite{Hicken2011} for an excellent review), there are several inconsistencies that authors tend to ignore or treat as unimportant empirical deviations. We believe that some of these inconsistencies originate in the wrong understanding of decision-making under risk. Consequently, rather than neglecting traditional theories of clientelism, our paper seeks to complement such progress by bridging several gaps in the literature. In this paper, we address two important inconsistencies relevant to the understanding of vote buying. We concentrate on these two aspects because both speak directly to the party's decision-making process under risk. 


\paragraph{Political Contestation} The first inconsistency in part of the clientelism literature is the role political contestation plays in vote buying. Whether parties target their resources when they are winning or losing the election is a fundamental question, yet some of the literature is quite inconclusive about this issue. In fact, \textcite[570]{Weitz-shapiro} suggests that ``there is no consensus about the relationship between high levels of political competition and the phenomenon of clientelism.'' 

% high
On the one hand, some explain that the more contested an election, and hence the more risk of losing the election, the more incentives to resort to vote buying \parencite{Scott1972,Shefter1977,Kitschelt2007,Diaz-Cayeros2008,Keefer2017,Corstange2018}. In fact, from a risk-management perspective, this approach makes sense. If we think of vote buying as an insurance against political losses, then utility-maximizer parties should ``buy insurance'' only in risky scenarios, that is, in cases when the expected electoral outcome is a loss. As \textcite[111]{Arrow1996} explains, ``those most at risk will buy more insurance than the others,'' a behavior that he describes as ``adverse selection.'' 

% low
Yet, there are recent contributions that report very large levels of vote buying in contexts of \emph{low} political contestation (like the Nicaraguan example mentioned above, see \cite{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012}).\footnote{In fact, other notable examples include cases where political participation is effectively banned, like in Russia \parencite{Saikkonen2021}. However, due to space concerns we leave both authoritarian clientelism \parencite{Miscoiu2021} and competitive authoritarian clientelist cases for future research.} This literature argues that vote buying can be higher in contexts of low political contestation. For instance, \textcite{Medina2002} explain that political parties that hold an electoral monopoly tend to offer clientelist goods to deter the entry of political challengers. Similarly, \textcite{Magaloni:2008bq} explains that hegemonic autocracies such as the PRI in Mexico have survived thanks to successful deterrence strategies and clientelism (see also \cite[146]{Hagene2015}). At the end of the day, however, the question still stands: When should vote buying be higher, in contexts of high or low political contestation? We believe that this lack of consensus is due in part to a misunderstanding of a party's decision-making under risk.


% while \textcite[146]{Hagene2015} is very categorical when she explains that ``political competition does not undermine political clientelism.'' 

%We believe that if traditional theories of vote buying conformed with traditional expectations of utility maximization, clientelist political parties should buy votes only in cases of risking the election. Yet, they do when electoral risks are low, as found in \textcite{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012}.\footnote{Regarding insurance purchasing, this has also been noted by \textcite{Kahneman1979} and \textcite[620-622]{Camerer:1995}.}


\paragraph{Sunk Costs} In other respects, our argument somewhat conforms with past research, but for different reasons. Our overall explanation is different because it considers that decision-makers weigh their options with respect to a reference point, which in turn explains higher levels of vote buying. Traditional vote-buying theories usually explain that incumbents enjoy important comparative advantages relative to political challengers. Since incumbents are in office while campaigning, they are usually able to divert public resources to vote buying \parencite{Cox1986a,Dixit1996,Dahlberg2002,Hicken2007,Grzymala-busse2008}. While incumbents' relatively higher levels of clientelist spending may be explained by their disposable public resources, we believe this is a necessary but insufficient condition to explain vote buying.%\footnote{Having more available resources has been associated with deterring likely challengers \parencite{Medina2002,Grzymala-busse2008}.}

Building on \textcite[33]{Szwarcberg2013}, we posit that having the \emph{capacity} to buy votes is a necessary but insufficient condition to explain the \emph{use} of clientelism. Thus, while incumbents might have more available resources, they will not necessarily engage more aggressively in vote buying. Taking this important insight as a starting point, we consider an additional scope condition under which clientelist political parties spend more on vote buying. In particular, we argue that incumbents not only need to have the capacity to deliver---as traditional accounts of vote buying assert---but also have a history of large prior investments; the larger prior spending levels are, the larger the spendings will be. The argument does not rely on some deterministic treat of the incumbent but about the need to compensate for prior losses or ``sunk costs.''

Incumbents are usually portrayed as if they were always in the domain of gains, as the ``incumbency \emph{advantage}'' concept implies. However, we tend to disagree with this view. First, the material, coordination, and political costs of maintaining a large-scale vote-buying operation is very high \parencite{Scott1969,Auyero2000,Szwarcberg2013}. Party machines need to have the capacity to grant public jobs to their clients \parencite{Calvo2004}, but also to organize rallies \parencite{Szwarcberg2012}, deliver benefits \parencite{Brusco2004}, ``\emph{acarrear}'' \parencite[577]{Hilgers2011} and monitor clients at the best of the machine's abilities \parencite[317]{Stokes2005}. Second, incumbents face a number of uncertainties. Party machines cannot effectively monitor their clients \parencite{Hicken2011} and struggle obtaining resources to be delivered in a clientelist manner \parencite{Auyero2000,Zarazaga2014}. If vote buying is expensive and uncertain, What motivates clientelist political parties to buy such massive numbers of votes, as the Nicaraguan example above suggested? In this context of uncertainty and risk, we argue that clientelist political parties will ``gamble'' more money and resources to compensate for prior losses. For every additional unit incumbents spend on vote buying, they will feel the need to spend even more to ``break even'' to try to compensate for prior losses or clientelist investments.



%Intuitively, from a portfolio-diversification standpoint, investing in both swing and core voters should be the best response: the more diversified the targeted electorate (i.e., the ``portfolio''), the less risk of losing the election (particularly in contexts of secret voting and monitoring and enforcing problems---\cite{Hicken2020}; see also \cite[58]{Auyero2000}). In fact, according to the financial market, portfolio choice and investment decision-making literatures in economics, ``[m]ost rational models of portfolio choice suggest that investors hold diversified portfolios to reduce or eliminate non-compensated risk'' \parencite{Goetzmann2008}. In the same vein, \textcite[978]{Goyal2003} ``find a significant positive relation between average stock variance and the return on the market.'' 

% adds secondary question about possibility
%Moreover, can parties even \emph{identify} either type of voters? We believe that the clientelism literature expects too much from the party's monitoring capacities. Parties operate in very uncertain environments, particularly due to vote secrecy and social stigma, making both monitoring and enforcing very hard to accomplish \parencite{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012,GonzalezOcantos2014,Gonzalez-Ocantos2015,KiewietDeJonge2015,Corstange2018,Hicken2020,Bahamonde2020a}. Hence assuming that parties can ``clinically'' discern who is a swing or a core voter, exceeds the real capacities of clientelist brokers. Ethnographic evidence for the Latin American cases seems to suggest similar ideas \parencite{Gay:1993aa,Gay1998,Auyero2000,Luna2011,Szwarcberg2013}.\footnote{Even normative scholars explain that parties have a hard time identifying voter's electoral intentions. For instance, \textcite[1147]{Dixit1996} explain that clientelist parties track ``constituents' likes and dislikes, \emph{compulsively} participating in a spectrum of events [such as] baptisms and bar mitzvahs.'' Similarly, \textcite[317]{Stokes2005} argues that parties develop skills that allow them to infer whether clients voted for their party by \emph{looking at them in the eyes} (emphasis is mine).} Thus, it is very reasonable that parties not knowing \emph{exactly} who is who, allocate clientelist resources to both types of voters. 

% there are other contributions too
% Moreover, recent contributions suggest that clientelist parties ``may simultaneously target both swing and core groups of voters'' \parencite[1083]{Albertus2012a}, while in a similar vein \textcite[148]{Diaz-Cayeros2008} explains that long-lasting hegemonic parties (such as the PRI in Mexico) seek ``to prevent core voters from defecting in the future,'' but newly elected incumbents in need of forging a new majority coalition target swing voters. In turn, and also considering the role of political contestation on vote buying, \textcite{Corstange2018} explains that parties target inexpensive core voters, but that higher levels of electoral contestation puts heavy pressures to target more expensive swing voters. Unfortunately, the role of political contestation is not clear either. 

% We believe this confusion is due to the wrong understanding of decision-making under risk. While core-voter scholars argue that parties minimize the risk of wasting scarce resources by targeting known individuals, swing-voter scholars explain that parties minimize the risk of losing the election by targeting individuals who \emph{ex-ante} were not voting for the clientelist party. Unfortunately both accounts assume that 



% summary
In sum, the way in which the literature assesses the role of political contestation and sunk costs on vote buying leaves many unaddressed gaps. First, part of the literature seems to suggest that clientelist political parties waste valuable resources when buying votes in uncontested elections. Second, the literature explains higher levels of clientelist spending by focusing only on current available resources while overlooking the role of prior losses or investments on vote buying (i.e., sunk costs). We interpret this apparent ``misbehavior'' \parencite{Thaler:2015vy} as an analytical problem, particularly, a misunderstanding of how political parties make decisions under risk. To bridge these gaps, the next section introduces prospect theory \parencite{Kahneman1979} to the study of vote buying. Importantly, this section sheds light on why parties buy votes when they are winning the election and why sunk costs might explain massive spendings on vote buying.

\section{Prospect Theory and Its Implications for Clientelism: When Losses Loom Larger than Gains}

% the best theory was developed
Prospect theory is a theory of decision making under conditions of risk \parencite[15]{McDermott1998}, and it was developed by \textcite{Kahneman1979} as a way to incorporate empirically observed violations of expected utility (\cite[179]{Levy1992a}, \cite[290]{McDermott2004}). Since its development, prospect theory has emerged as a ``leading alternative'' \parencite[171]{Levy1992a}, ``best available description,'' \parencite[173]{Barberis2013} and ``empirically correct theory'' \parencite[334]{Vis2011} about how people evaluate risk \parencite[5]{Ackert2006}, particularly excelling in providing a model that offers ``descriptively accurate formulations'' of the human decision-making process \parencite[292]{McDermott2004}.\footnote{Descriptive analyses focus on decision-making processes ``as they are,'' in sharp contrast to normative analyses, where the focus is on ``how they should be'' (\cite[341]{Kahneman1984a}, see also \cite{Thaler1980a}).}


% influence of the theory--where else this theory has been applied.
While the theory has been most influential among international relations scholars, it has unfortunately had ``limited'' influence on political science as a whole \parencite[2]{Mercer2005}. Still, there are several contributions in comparative politics that take prospect theory as a framework. For instance, \textcite{Weyland2002} studies levels of loss aversion of dictatorships when they perform radical economic reforms. \textcite{Vis2009,Vis:2010tq} study welfare state reform showing that political gains are the necessary condition for not-unpopular reforms, while deteriorating socio-economic situations or political losses are necessary for unpopular reforms. Additionally, \textcite{Steinacker2006} studies issue salience, \textcite{Schumacher2015} focuses on party platform change, while \textcite{Carreras2019} argues that ``citizens who were in the domain of economic losses were more likely to take a risk and vote in favor of Brexit.''


% main principles and contrasts with EUT
Since others have already provided very comprehensive overviews of prospect theory \parencite{Levy1992a,Levy1992,Levy1997,McDermott1998,McDermott2004,Mercer2005,Mercer2005,Vis2011,Barberis2013,Linde2017,Vieider2019}, we will limit this section to describing its main components.\footnote{For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the main implications of the value function, leaving other aspects of the theory, such as the probability weighting function \parencite[220-221]{Levy2003} for future research.} The theory is based on two empirically derived concepts \parencite[334]{Vieider2019}. First, utilities are defined over changes in outcomes with respect to a reference point (``reference dependence''). Note the sharp contrast with expected value theories, where the focus is on absolute levels of wealth \parencite[5-6]{Ackert2006}. Second, individuals distort values of possible outcomes in an asymmetrical, non-linear, S-shaped way when making risky decisions (``value-function dependence''). Note also another important difference with expected value theories, where agents are assumed to treat expected utility values linearly, ``even with training and effort'' \parencite[293]{McDermott2004}.\footnote{Note that expected utility theory essentially assumes a non-linear utility function for risk averse and risk acceptant (but not risk averse) actors. I thank one of the reviewers for this comment.} As \textcite[18]{McDermott1998} clearly summarize it, ``prospect theory predicts that individuals tend to be risk averse in a domain of gains, and relatively risk seeking in a domain of losses.'' This distinction also separates prospect theory from expected value theory, where the latter assume that whether decision-makers are in a domain of gain or loss should not affect their attitude toward risk \parencite[1]{Mercer2005}.


% central idea in prospect theory (Reference dependence)
Reference dependence is the central idea in prospect theory (\cite[40]{McDermott1998}, \cite[178]{Barberis2013}). This aspect of the theory allows people's preferences to depend on the circumstances they face (\cite[1412]{March1987}, \cite[293]{McDermott2004}, \cite[294]{McDermott2004}, \cite[168]{Fatas2007}), which is usually \parencite[335]{Vis2011}, but not always \parencite[174]{Levy1992a}, the \emph{status quo},\footnote{The location of the reference point emerges as a critical factor in the analysis of decisions \parencite[288]{Kahneman1979}. \textcite[174]{Levy1992a} explains that the reference point could also be an ``aspiration level.'' In a similar way, \textcite[1135]{Koszegi2006} developed the idea of a reference point that consists of  ``expectations rather than the status quo.'' We owe this point to Salomo Hirvonen.} and how it shifts over time (\cite[28]{McDermott1998}, \cite[301]{McDermott2004}).\footnote{While we do not focus on the role of emotions, others have found that ``sad people will take more risk when trying to avoid a certain loss'' \parencite[6]{Campos-Vazquez2014}.} As \textcite[273]{Kahneman1979} put it more clearly, ``the carriers of value or utility are changes of wealth, rather than final asset positions.'' Simply put, prospect theory pays considerable attention to losses.\footnote{Losses have also been the focus in other areas of political science \parencite[298]{McDermott2004}. For instance, \textcite[132]{Lau1985} explains that ``negative information is more influential than comparable positive information.''} In fact, \textcite[171]{Levy1992a} explains that individuals ``give more weight to losses than to comparable gains,'' which translates into the famous statement \emph{losses loom larger than gains}. An important consequence is that, contrary to the assumption of invariance \parencite[186]{Barberis2013}, a shift in the reference point should also lead to reversals of preferences (\cite[719]{Quattrone1988}, \cite[643]{Thaler1990}, \cite[218]{Levy2003}). %For instance, there is strong support for the idea that prior losses or ``sunk costs'' influence decisions, contrary to what normative theorists propose (\cite[643]{Thaler1990}, \cite[218]{Levy2003}). 



% central idea in prospect theory (value-function dependence), % value-function dependence explained
Value-function dependence is another central idea in prospect theory. Importantly, the shape of the value function is non-linear. From an analytical point of view, we consider this to be \emph{the} feature that trumps the normative expectations contained in standard expected-value theories. In the domain of gains, the concavity of the value function encourages risk aversion, while in the domain of losses, the convexity of the value function encourages risk-seeking behaviors \parencite[183-184]{Levy1992a}. Formally, the asymmetrical curvature of the value-function explains why individuals exhibit risk-averse behaviors in choices among gains but risk-acceptant behaviors in choices among losses \parencite[87]{Levy1997}. % Unlike theories based on expected-value calculations, \textcite{Kahneman:2012tc} explains that the process of underweighting of likely events contributes to risk aversion, while very unlikely events are overweighted ``quite grossly or neglected altogether'' (see also \cite[32]{McDermott1998}). % \textcite[32]{McDermott1998} explains that ``prospect theory accounts for these discrepancies by noting the extreme (over)weight and attention that individuals give to small probabilities.'' 

% to conclude PT section: most important empirical finding in PT
In prospect theory, both reference dependence and the shape of the value function lead to a more accurate description of decision-making under risk. In fact, experimental evidence consistently finds evidence of decision-makers distorting values of possible outcomes in a non-linear way \parencite[87]{Levy1997}. In particular, the evidence suggests that in the domain of losses, risk-seeking decision-makers take disproportionate risks to avoid certain losses, while in the domain of gains, risk-averse decision-makers are excessively eager to secure gains \parencite[297, 299-300]{Levy1992}. Finally, it is important to note that while attitudes toward risk are usually portrayed as aspects of personality \parencite[1406]{March1987}, prospect theory is \emph{not} a personality theory; that is, it is not necessary to know about the individual personality traits of decision-makers in order to predict behavior (\cite[293]{McDermott2004}, \cite[335]{Vis2011})

% This is explained because decision-makers ``have difficulty with probability at extreme ranges'' \parencite[30]{McDermott1998}
 
% implications for vote buying
The implications for vote buying are considerable. In sharp contrast to traditional vote-buying theories, prospect theory predicts that clientelist parties will likely buy votes when they are winning the election, that is, when they are in the domain of gains. In these scenarios, parties will find unbearable the idea of potentially losing the supporter base they already have, particularly because decision-makers are more concerned with \emph{preventing} a decline than increasing gains (\cite{Levy1992}, \cite[89]{Levy1997}). Analytically, under such circumstances of ``loss aversion'' \parencite{Kahneman1984a,Kahneman1991a,Levy1992a,McDermott2004,Mercer2005}---i.e., parties giving more weight to potential losses---the value function will encourage risk-averse behaviors, making investments in vote buying more attractive. 

Importantly, it should be noted that the aversion is respect to potential negative electoral outcomes (i.e., losing an already acquired supporter base). This is consistent with prospect theory, particularly, with the concept of ``endowment effect:'' the very process of acquiring something (e.g. a supporter base) enhances the value of the object \parencite{Thaler1980a,Kahneman1990a}. In these situations, decision-makers (parties) tend to over-value current possessions \parencite[175]{Levy1992a}, making the risky strategy (vote buying) seem more attractive. In fact, \textcite{Horowitz2002} find that losing something looms 2.5 times more than obtaining it, thus making agents more eager to hold on to the good. Our argument is also consistent with \textcite[1042]{Schumacher2015}, where they also find that ``loss aversion motivates [agents] to become risk acceptant.'' Then, in the context of vote buying we argue that the idea of losing something (voters) shifts the decision-maker's reference point (party), driving them to take the risky alternative (vote buying). 

Hence, we expect vote buying to be higher in contexts where parties are winning the election. Decision makers in those situations will find intolerable the idea of losing acquired assets---this also applies even to ``trivial [ones, such] as candy bars or coffee mugs'' \parencite[175]{Levy1992a}. Note that this goes in line with other empirical studies that also confirm that ``actors perceive themselves to be in the domain of losses more often than we would normally expect,'' even if they are not (\cite[291]{Levy1992}; see also \cite{Lau1985}). Thus, both loss aversion and the endowment effect will imply that winning parties will perceive themselves in the domain of losses more often, making them more prone to gamble more on vote buying.

% an enhanced // enhancing then the false perception that agents might actually be in the domain of losses. 

% 2 why Clientelist parties should buy votes when they have experienced important losses or spendings in the past
Moving forward, clientelist parties can also be expected to buy more votes when they are in the domain of losses because of risk-seeking. In these cases, vote buying should be higher when they have experienced important losses or when they have had high spending levels in the past. In line with prospect theory, we argue that past losses are harder to accept, and hence when things have been bad in the past, decision-makers are more likely to make risky choices ``today'' to recover ``yesterday's'' losses \parencite[294]{McDermott2004}. Analytically, \textcite[297]{Levy1992} notes that the elasticity of the risk-seeking behavior is quite high because the magnitudes of past losses need not be large in order to induce the behavior. This means that even small losses can be expected to induce risk-seeking behaviors. Consequently, we expect a steeper predicted effect in the data analyses. 


Importantly, the risk-seeking behavior is with respect to vote buying as a strategy. By shifting the decision-makers' reference point downward, vote buying seems more attractive because of the tendency of individuals in the domain of losses to try to ``break-even''  \parencite{Thaler1990}. This implies that clientelist political parties should be expected to buy more votes, not necessarily because they want to win the next election but because they will try to compensate for past losses or ``sunk costs.''\footnote{Due to the ``cost of governing'' \parencite{Powell1993,Nannestad2002,Bawn2012}, \textcite[1041]{Schumacher2015} empirically find that incumbents in the domain of losses take more risks. In terms of our argument, we also find it might be plausible that incumbents fear losing office, thus incentivizing more investments in clientelism. However, while our explanation complements theirs, our formal model, the experimental design and the data analyses focus on the relationship between incumbency and sunk costs (i.e., the need to break even with past investments). Building on \textcite{Schumacher2015}, we encourage future experimental research to problematize the incumbent's risk of losing office. I thank one of the reviewers for this suggestion.} We theorize that clientelist parties will buy more votes when their past electoral losses or past levels of clientelist investments have been high. Clientelist parties that have a history of lost elections or that have invested considerable amounts in vote buying in the past are possible examples of this mechanism.

\section{Experimental Design: Buying Votes in the Lab}

% formal model
Formal models can usually help experimentalists to determine which theoretical settings and equilibria are most relevant to a particular causal hypothesis (\cite{McDermott2002}, \cite{Aldrich2011} and \cite[174]{Barberis2013}). Thus, in \autoref{formal:model} we developed a vote-buying game within the Downsian ``spatial'' paradigms \parencite{Downs:1957vg,Enelow:1990aa}. The idea was to test the normative accuracy of the game-theory model in an experimental context (\cite{Lupia:1998ub}, \cite[559]{Bassi2011}, \cite{Dickson2011}, \cite[361]{Tyszler2016}, \cite[1]{Vieider2019}).

%The model tried to account for several alternative causal explanations of vote buying. While there are a number of important issues that have been studied, the model paid attention to three of what we consider are the main ones. 



% role
Building on the formal model, we designed a lab economic experiment. As \autoref{experimental:design:fig} shows, at the beginning of every game, participants received a role at random. Following \textcite{Dickson2011}, roles were presented using neutral terminology to maximize experimental control. The design incorporated the following roles: \emph{party A}, \emph{party B}, or \emph{voter}. Every game was played among three players (one \emph{party A}, one \emph{party B}, and one \emph{voter}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.9, center]{Experimental_Flow_Figure.pdf}
\caption{{\bf Experimental Flow and Timing of the Voting Game.\label{experimental:design:fig}}}
\caption*{{\bf Note}: At the beginning of each experimental session, all participants were required to successfully complete two practice rounds. A total of \Sexpr{as.numeric(length(unique(v.buying.dat$participant.code)))} subjects were recruited. Each subject played the game three times, for a total sample size of \Sexpr{as.numeric(nrow(dat.v.b))}. For every new game, a whole new randomization process took place. Formally, we follow an in-between-subjects design, where different groups of individuals are randomly assigned to various experimental or control conditions.}\centering
\end{figure}

 
% ideology 1
Voters were assigned an ``ideological'' position at random. That is, voters received at random a certain number of experimental points depending on whether party A or B won the election. For example, if party A won the election, the voter would receive 2,400 points, whereas if party B won the election, the voter would receive 200 points. Hence, the voter in this example should feel ``ideologically'' closer to party A. Critically, this piece of information was not presented to participants as ``ideology,'' but as the points either electoral outcome would give. In turn, parties also received an ``ideological'' position that made them ``closer'' or ``farther way'' from the voter.  

% ideology 2
Substantively, this design accomplishes two goals. First, it models party-voter spatial distances, as considered by traditional voting theories \parencite{Downs:1957vg, Enelow:1990aa}. The basic premise of this paradigm is that the set of candidates that are ideologically closer to a voter produce more utility in the form of fiscal policies, either in terms of redistributive or free-market oriented policies (\cite{Acemoglu:1996rm,Boix:2003db}, but importantly, see \cite{Haggard:2016vr}). Second, it enables us to incorporate both the clientelist targeting and the core/swing voter debates.\footnote{Due to space concerns, we do not expand on this debate from a prospect theory standpoint. Additionally, we only consider these two ideal types of voters. There are other types that we do not discuss in this paper for simplicity. For instance, \textcite[7]{Zarazaga2015a} introduces another category---``conditional supporters''---who ``will vote for the party machine only as long as unexpected events do not persuade them to do otherwise.'' In addition to that, we acknowledge that (single-issue) spatial distances might roughly sort core and swing voters in an ideological continuum. Hence, we believe that core voters should be closer to parties while swing voters should be farther away.} We believe it is relevant to account for these issues because the vote-buying literature seems to be quite divided. In fact, \textcite[14]{Carlin2015} state that ``our knowledge of who parties target remains incomplete.'' On the one hand, \textcite{Cox1986a} and \textcite[7]{Zarazaga2015a} explain that since constituencies are well known to clientelist parties, they allocate resources to core voters. On the other hand, \textcite{Lindbeck1987,Dixit1996,Dahlberg2002,Stokes2005} argue that since allocating resources to individuals who \emph{ex ante} vote for the party is a waste, parties target swing voters. By devising a formal model and an experimental design that considers single-issue ideological positions for both parties and voters, it was then possible to allow parties to target their own/rival supporters. 


% endowments
Next, parties received different ``endowments'' at random as well. Note that both parties receive the same endowment. Since our experimental design is an in-between-subjects design, we should be able to observe and exploit the statistical differences (if any) across ``parties'' with different endowments. Participants acting the ``party'' role accumulated or lost wealth depending on whether they are elected or not elected. Every time they bought votes at some amount, that amount was discounted from their wealth. 

The substantive idea was to reflect the fact that some parties are wealthier than others, a factor that might increase the probability of vote buying  \parencite{Juan-Pablo-Luna:2014wp}. Importantly, it is not clear whether having more resources leads to more clientelism. On the one hand, \textcite{Szwarcberg2013} explains that having economic and material resources available does not necessarily cause more vote buying. Similarly, \textcite[147]{Hagene2015} finds that political clientelism is ``perfectly possible without controlling public funds.'' On the other hand, \textcite{Bahamonde2018} explains that parties with larger budgets will engage in more expensive forms of clientelism, even buying votes from the wealthy. Thus, the formal model and the experiment might shed light on these issues.

Finally, participants acting the ``voter'' role accumulated or lost wealth depending on whether their party was elected or not elected (as per traditional spatial voting theories) and on whether they decided to sell or not sell their vote. For simplicity, voters received zero initial endowments. It is important to note that following our formal model and \textcite[371]{Tyszler2016}, both ideology and party endowments were common knowledge among participants. 



% vote share
Moving forward, both parties received at random an initial vote share, that is, a \emph{certain} number of (fictional) voters that were going to cast their votes for each party. Overall, this experimental condition mimics the degree to which an election is contested. In particular, this portion of the design accomplishes two goals. First, it puts parties in different electoral contestation environments. In other words, it introduces the element of risk (of losing the election) in the game. Since voters win or lose points when their parties win or lose elections, this risk is also relevant for players acting the ``voter'' role. Second, it gives (or not) voters a certain amount of electoral leverage. Since \textcite{Downs:1957vg}, traditional spatial theories of voting have considered that pivotal voters have more weight in an election, and hence, they might have incentive to sell their vote at higher prices. It is key in our experimental design that all these pieces of information are public.

% pivotal
%Third, it allows to consider whether pivotal voters where targeted by clientelist parties more often than non-pivotal voters. Since \textcite{Downs:1957vg}, traditional spatial theories of voting have considered pivotal voters as more decisive. %Hence, in the model we accounted for such electoral scenarios. All in all, the formal model tries to incorporate these factors that might explain different vote-buying dynamics. 



During the second stage, parties decide whether to buy votes and make an offer to the voter. Experimental subjects acting the ``party'' role that want to buy votes enter a number of points, which ranged from zero to the maximum assigned budget in that round.\footnote{Participants acting the ``party'' role are told that offering a zero amount means that they do not want to buy votes at that time.} The design allows for simultaneous offers (i.e., offers from both parties), one offer, or zero offers. In the third stage, voters evaluate offers (if any). If the party(s) decided that it (they) did not want to make an offer at that time, the voter is told that the party(s) did not make an offer. Voters are told that accepting the offer necessarily implies voting for that party.\footnote{For simplicity, we did not include the possibility of defecting. We encourage future designs to include this feature.} 




% administrative
Finally, the experiment was conducted in Chile by the \emph{Centre for Experimental Social Sciences (CESS)} administered by the \emph{University of Santiago} and \emph{Oxford University, Nuffield College} between \Sexpr{min(format(as.Date(dat$participant.time_started), format="%B %d %Y"))} and \Sexpr{max(format(as.Date(dat$participant.time_started), format="%B %d %Y"))}. It was programmed in \texttt{O-tree}, the online version of \texttt{Z-tree} \parencite{Fischbacher2007}. Following \textcite{Harrison2006} and others, our experimental design minimizes hypothetical bias and ``cheap talk'' by compensating subjects with real money according to their decisions \parencite{Morton:2010ly,Dickson2011}. At the beginning of each experimental session all participants were required to successfully complete two practice rounds.\footnote{To make sure participants understood the dynamics of the game, they were shown two examples of the voting game. Participants were required to enter the correct number of points each hypothetical participant would have received in each example. Importantly, all actual participants had to enter the exact number of points to continue playing the game.} Those data were not used in the statistical analyses. In addition, subjects received a show-up payment of \$2,000 CLP ($\approx$ \texteuro2.1). Payoffs depended on the quality of individual decisions.\footnote{\textcite[95]{Levy1997} notes that in poorer societies (like the Chilean society), conducting research with relatively smaller monetary incentives is still meaningful. However, see \textcite{Morton:2010ly,Bassi2011}.} \autoref{payoffs:plot:fig} shows the distribution of payoffs expressed in actual currency, by role. \autoref{summary:stats:t} shows summary statistics broken down by pre-treatment observables. These covariates were captured by a battery of socio-demographic questions delivered at the end of the study.\footnote{The table also details the same information conveyed in \autoref{payoffs:plot:fig}.} A total of \Sexpr{as.numeric(length(unique(v.buying.dat$participant.code)))} subjects were recruited. Each subject played the game three times. The total sample size is \Sexpr{as.numeric(nrow(dat.v.b))}. For every new game, a whole new randomization process took place.\footnote{That is, participants received a role, an ``ideology,'' a party endowment and a contestability structure.} Formally, we follow an in-between-subjects design, where different groups of individuals are randomly assigned to various experimental or control conditions \parencite{McDermott2002,Tyszler2016,Hwang2021}.

% experimental points
Finally, all transactions were performed exchanging experimental ``points.'' We endeavored to employ neutral terminology to maximize experimental control \parencite{Dickson2011}. Thus, throughout all three games, participants bought and sold votes (if any) and accumulated and lost wealth expressed purely in experimental points. Every experimental point was equivalent to \$\Sexpr{as.numeric(unique(dat$session.config.real_world_currency_per_point))} CLP ($\approx$ \texteuro0.00045). Participants learned about the conversion when reading the initial instructions. Final payoffs were converted to actual currency at the end of the study.



\section{Statistical Analyses: Risk and Vote Buying}


% internal validity
Since the focus of this paper is on vote-buying, we discarded the voter data and analyzed all observations $i$ acting any of the party roles (\emph{party A} and \emph{party B}). In practice, this leaves the data formatted in party-voter dyads. Moving forward, in this paper, we concentrate on one main dependent variable, namely, the amount of the vote-buying offers made by parties (if any). The distribution of such this variable is shown in \autoref{dep:var:plot:fig}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.6, center]{depvarplot.png}
\caption{{\bf Distribution of the Dependent Variable.\label{dep:var:plot:fig}}}
\caption*{{\bf Note}: Since the focus of this paper is on vote buying, we discarded the voter data. The new sample size consisting only of parties is N = \Sexpr{nrow(m1.d)} (mean = \Sexpr{round(mean(m1.d$offer.made.party),0)}, median = \Sexpr{round(median(m1.d$offer.made.party),0)}).}\centering
\end{figure}

% internal validity
From an internal validity standpoint, we expect this distribution to vary with the levels of risk the party is dealing with. Accordingly, if the predictions of our formal model (and those of the traditional vote-buying theories) are correct, the amount of the vote-buying offers made by parties should be higher in riskier scenarios (i.e., when facing probable electoral losses). Since vote share, ideological positions, and endowments were public information (as formalized in our game), we believe these theoretical expectations should be consistent with the expectations of the traditional vote-buying literature.

% external validity
From an external validity standpoint, we believe that voters in real elections can estimate, with some degree of success, actual vote shares (for instance, by looking at electoral polls). Voters can also identify parties' ideological positions. For example, \textcite{Luna2005} identify a number of conditions that are associated with higher levels of elite-mass congruence in Latin America.\footnote{However, see \textcite{Visconti2021}.} Voters can also make inferences about a party's endowment, and how those endowments can be redistributed in a clientelist fashion \parencite{Auyero2000}. In turn, the literature is consistent in that brokers also provide necessary information about available resources and how to gain access to them \parencite{Murillo2021a}. In sum, we believe this identification strategy appropriately captures the decision-making process of political parties under risk as theorized by traditional vote-buying scholars.

% theoretical expectations
However, based on prospect theory, we have different expectations: parties should buy votes due to risk-aversion in the domain of gains (i.e., when winning the election as the idea of losing sure electoral support becomes unbearable), and due to risk-seeking in the domain of losses (i.e., when having experienced higher levels of sunk costs). To test these hypotheses we exploit the experimental data described above by fitting the OLS regression model specified in \autoref{eq:ols},

% OLS Equation
{\input{ols_model.tex}\unskip}



where \emph{Vote Share} is the percentage of a certain number of (fictional) voters who were going to cast their votes for the party, while $\Delta\text{\emph{Points Accumulated}}$ captures changes in the accumulated points with respect to the experimental round played in $t-1$. For instance, if a player won 1,200 points at $t-1$ but then lost $500$ in the next round, then $\Delta\text{\emph{Points Accumulated}}_{t}=700$. Importantly, this variable captures sunk costs. The intuition is to determine whether they are \emph{not} considered when evaluating new proposals, as traditional expected-value theories posit. \emph{Party Budget} is the party budget, and $\alpha_{i}$ is a vector of participant fixed effects. 

Following our formal model, we also factor in a parameter \autoref{eq:ols} $\beta_{3}$ to test the effect of ideological and spatial distances on vote buying. Given the ongoing debate regarding parties target core or swinger voters, we do not have specific expectations regarding the sign of $\beta_{3}$. \autoref{eq:ols} also has a parameter $\beta_{4}$ to test the effect of having large budgets. Since it is still contested whether wealthier parties spend more on clientelism relative to poorer parties, we do not have clear expectations regarding the sign of $\beta_{4}$ either. Finally, $\beta_{5}$ tests whether parties engaged in more aggressive ways of vote buying by spending more resources on pivotal voters. Following the literature, we should expect that $\beta_{5}>0$.

Simply put, if traditional vote-buying theories are correct, then we should expect that the larger the vote share, the less vote buying that occurs (because there are less risks of losing the election), sunk costs should not matter for vote buying, and pivotal voters produce more expensive vote-buying offers. The closer a party is to the voter is either positive for vote buying (core voter hypothesis) or negative (swing voter hypothesis). The bigger the budget of a party, the more (less) vote buying. However, if the expectations conform with prospect theory, we should expect $\beta_{1}>0$ and $\beta_{2}<0$.


\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=.6, center]{m1plot.png}
\caption{{\bf Predicted Values of Vote-Buying Offer.\label{m1plot}}}
\caption*{{\bf Note}: Based on the OLS estimates in \autoref{reg:t}, the figure shows the predicted values of the offer made by the party expressed in experimental points. Confidence intervals were constructed using robust standard errors (as shown in \autoref{reg:t}). Substantively, the figure shows that experimental subjects avoid losses by over-securing electoral support even in favorable contexts (panel 1) and that they do consider sunk costs and try to recover losses in the short run by spending more on vote buying (panel 2). Panel 3 indicates that parties spend more on vote buying for voters closer to their ideological preferences. Panel 4 shows that larger party budgets incentivize more spending on vote buying, and that parties do not necessarily consider whether the voter is pivotal or not (panel 5).}\centering
\end{figure}


Substantive results are shown in \autoref{m1plot} (regression table is shown in \autoref{reg:t}). Overall, results clearly depart from the theoretical expectations of traditional vote-buying theories and widely support prospect theory. Parties do not buy votes when they are losing the election but do when they are winning the election (panel 1 in \autoref{m1plot}). As prospect theory predicts, decision-makers in the domain of gains will exaggerate the unlikely scenario of losing the election and will become more risk-averse, making the strategy of vote-buying more attractive. Second, unlike traditional expectations, parties will consider sunk costs in their calculations and will buy votes when experiencing prior losses (panel 2 in \autoref{m1plot}). That is, when parties are in the domain of losses (parties that have spent or lost a considerable amount of resources in the past), they will be more risk-seeking and gamble more money on vote buying.

In panel 3 of \autoref{m1plot} we find strong support for the core vote hypothesis: political parties buy votes more frequently from voters that are ideologically closer to them. However, we also find that political parties buy these votes at relatively \emph{higher prices} (counter to traditional core voter expectations). In panel 4, results show that parties with larger budgets buy votes at higher prices, while in panel 5 we find no support for the pivotal voter argument. 

\section{Discussion}

This paper began by identifying that the vote-buying literature has relied almost exclusively on expected-value assumptions at the cost of overlooking several empirical inconsistencies. We have identified two in particular, namely political contestation and the role of sunk costs. To clarify these empirical departures, we have applied basic concepts of prospect theory into the study of vote buying. After formalizing a voting game within the expected-value framework, we designed and implemented an economic experiment. Results widely conform with prospect theory. In particular, we concentrated our efforts on two findings. First, clientelist political parties buy more votes when they are probable winners because decision-makers in the domain of gains usually underweight (``play down'') the probability of electoral success, making risky strategies such as vote buying more attractive (risk-aversion). Second, clientelist political parties buy more votes when they have experienced larger sunk costs in the past because decision-makers in the domain of losses usually exaggerate the probability of unlikely electoral losses, making risky strategies such as vote buying more attractive (risk-seeking). Importantly, in these scenarios, parties that have gambled considerable amounts of resources in the past will tend to engage in more aggressive and expensive instances of vote buying to break even.


We encourage future research, particularly scholars in comparative politics, development, behavioral, and electoral studies, to consider prospect theory as a valid alternative to explain decision-making under risk. In our experiment, we had to sacrifice a number of important aspects, such as the probability of defection and the income distribution among voters. We intend to implement such considerations in future research.\todo{add cases where political participation is effectively banned \parencite{Saikkonen2021,Miscoiu2021}}\todo{add probability weighting function future research}

\todo{add limitation ``attitudes toward risk are not determined by the S-shaped value function alone'' \parencite[183]{Levy1992a}}

\todo{recycle later: Thus, in scenarios like these, parties overdo their spending on vote buying by acquiring more political safeties respect to their current electoral assets.}


\todo{add}To sum, when things are going well electorally, clientelist political parties will tend to buy more votes because ``future losses hurt more than future gains gratify'' \parencite[285]{Levy1992}. Thus, we expect vote buying to be an attractive strategy in favorable electoral scenarios due to the absolute aversion and intolerance of losing an already acquired important political base. %The mechanics of such a decision-making process should then make clear that there is no ``wasting'' when when buying votes while in the domain of gains.

\todo{add when ``retrospective investments in VB'' are higher}

\todo{recycle In short, our design mimics an electoral market, where we can observe under which conditions different clientelist dynamics developed.}

\subsection{A Formal Model of Vote Buying}\label{formal:model}

We consider an electorate of $n$ voters. Voters cast votes for a leader to implement a common policy $\gamma$ from the set $\Gamma=\{1,2,...,100\}$. Each citizen $i$ has an ideal point $x_i$, which is an \emph{iid} draw from an uniform distribution over $\Gamma$. When policy $\gamma$ is implemented, payoffs of citizen $i$ are given by $u(x_i,\gamma)=D-\vert x_i-\gamma \vert$, where $D$ represents the utility of implementing any given policy. This payoff can be incremented by transferences from both parties to voter $i$.

In this election, there are two candidates. One ``left-wing'' party and one ``right-wing'' party. The left-wing (right-wing) candidate represents a policy $\gamma_L$ ($\gamma_R$), which is an \emph{iid} draw from an uniform distribution over $\{1,...,50\}$ ($\{51,...,100\}$). The location of these policies ($\gamma_L$ and $\gamma_R$) give us the number of voters $n_L$ leaning towards the left-wing candidate, while the number of voters leaning towards the right-wing party is given by $n_L+n_R=n$. While we consider that voters are attached to an ideological continuum, we do so with the sole purpose of modeling preferences---both formally and experimentally.\footnote{Ultimately, experimental subjects are not told anything about ideology. They only observe that there are a number of ``points'' associated with the victory of party A or party B. In this sense, voters lean (``ideologically'') towards the party that gives them more points.}

Both parties negotiate with only one of these $n$ voters. That voter is randomly selected from the total population $n$. Observe that the higher the $n$, the lower the representation in the election of this voter. That is, a larger $n$ necessarily implies that every individual electoral choice matters less. However, if $n$ is small, negotiating with this voter may be more attractive to political parties. This is because negotiating with a large number of voters is costly. We assume that each party has a budget ($B$) that they can use to buy votes. If a party decides not to negotiate with the voter (or the voter does not accept the offer), the party keeps this budget. The profits of party $i$ is given by,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \pi_i(s_i,a_j)=W\cdot e_i+(1-s_i\cdot a_j )\cdot B
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $W$ ($W\geq B$) is a constant that represents how much each party values winning the election, $e_i=1$ if party $i$ wins the election, 0 otherwise, and $s_i$ is the fraction of $B$ that the party offers to voter $j$ who can accept the offer ($a_j=1$) or not ($a_j=0$). We study one version of this party-voter interaction, namely, when both parties make simultaneous offers to the voter, and voters decide whether to accept the offer or not. 

%We study two versions of this party-voter interaction. One is where both parties make simultaneous offers to the voter, and she decides whether to accept the offer (vote-buying case). Another one is where the voter can make private offers to both parties, and then the party decides if to pay or not for that voter's vote (vote-selling case).

The timing of the game is as follows: at the beginning of the game, $n$ voters and two political parties are randomly located on their respective ideal points: voters along $\Gamma$, the ``left-wing'' candidate along $\{1,...,50\}$, and the ``right-wing'' candidate on $\{51,...,100\}$. All locations are public information, as well as every party's budget $B$, the total number of voters ($n$), and the number of supporters of each party ($n_L$ and $n_R$). In this game, each party simultaneously decides whether to make a vote-buying offer to the voter. If a party decides to negotiate with the voter, the party privately offers the voter to buy his vote. Then the voter decides whether or not to take the offer, or which one to accept if he receives two offers. If he accepts an offer, he should vote for that candidate.\footnote{It is important to consider that to simplify the game (and the experiment), accepting the offer necessarily implies compliance. That is, accepting the offer means voting for the party the voter accepted the offer from. We leave for future research the case where the voter may defect.} %On the vote-selling case, the voter may privately propose a certain amount to each party in exchange for her vote. Then the parties decide if to pay or not the offer. The voter then decides which one to accept, if any. In this case, the voter offers to one or both parties, and each proposed amount might be different.

\paragraph{Equilibrium} In this case, both parties can offer certain amounts in exchange for electoral support. Note that parties only have incentive to negotiate with a voter if he is the pivotal voter. That means that $\vert n_L -n_R \vert \leq 1$, and that voter $i$ supports the ex-ante winner of the election ($i\in max\{n_L,n_R\}$). The voter prefers the party closer to her ideal point. If both parties are located at the same distance, the voter is indifferent. Denote by $i^*\in \{L,R\}$ the preferred party of the voter, and $-i^*$ the other party. 
 
Note that, naturally, both parties will want to make different offers. If the voter is pivotal, the less preferred party has incentive to offer him a certain amount $m_{-i^*}$, such that he perceives more utility voting for that party rather than voting for the opposite party, expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    m_{-i^*} &\geq \left( D-\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{i^*} \vert \right) - \left( D-\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{-i^*} \vert \right)\\
     &=\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{-i^*} \vert- \vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{i^*} \vert . 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Parties expect winning the election but have limited budgets. Hence, they want to win the election at a minimum cost. Given that $\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{-i^*} \vert >\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{i^*} \vert$, it is more difficult for the opposite party to incentivize the voter to change votes. If the opposite party offers to the voter all its budget $m_{-i^*}=B$, the party $i^*$ may offer him $m_{i^*}=\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{-i^*} \vert- \vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{i^*} \vert+B$ and the voter will end up indifferent to both parties. Therefore, in equilibrium, the preferred party offers $m_{i^*}=\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{-i^*} \vert- \vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{i^*} \vert+B$, the opposite party offers $m_{-i^*}=B$, and the voter accepts the offer of party $i^*$.


%If party $-i^*$ offers the voter $m_{-i^*}=\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{-i^*} \vert- \vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{i^*} \vert$, he will be indifferent between voting for party $i^*$ or party $-i^*$. Both offers $m_{i^*}=0$ and $m_{-i^*}=\vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{-i^*} \vert- \vert x_{i^*}-\gamma_{i^*} \vert$ are the minimum amount, but enough to make the pivotal voter indifferent between both political parties. Indifference gives the party some electoral advantage of winning of the election. Voter indifference gives two possible Nash equilibria. In one equilibrium the voter rejects the offer and votes for $i^*$. In the other equilibrium, the voter accepts the offer and the elected party is $-i^*$. If individuals are utility maximizers, they should be indifferent between these two equilibria. %However, if we frequently observe that voters reject offers, this would give us some light that the players have other motivations. For example, more politicized players may be more likely to reject offers from the less preferred party.

% ``[managers] believe that fewer risks should, and would, be taken when things are going well. They expect riskier choices to be made when an organization is `failing'.'' March1987, 1409

% ``In classical decision theory, risk is most commonly conceived as reflecting variation in the distribution of possible outcomes.'' March1987, 1404

% Scholars mostly agree on the positive correlation between poverty and clientelism \parencite{Calvo2004,Weitz-shapiro,Kitschelt2000,Kitschelt2015}.\footnote{Following \textcite[316]{Nichter2014}, clientelist vote-buying is defined as ``the distribution of rewards to individuals or small groups during elections in contingent exchange for vote choices.''} Since the poor derive more utility from immediate transfers than the uncertain returns associated with future policy packages, clientelist political parties only target the poor (\textcite{Brusco2004,Stokes:2013cj}). Indeed, \textcite[12]{Weitz-Shapiro:2014aa} explained that ``[a]lmost universally, scholars of clientelism treat and analyze [this] practice as an exchange between politicians and their poor clients.'' 

% challenge: income
% This agreement has recently been challenged \parencite[55]{Hicken2007}. \textcite{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012} and \textcite[]{Holland2015} found that income had little or no effect on vote-buying. For instance, \textcite[32]{Szwarcberg2013} ``challenges the assumption [that brokers] with access to material benefits will always distribute goods to low-income voters in exchange for electoral support.'' In fact, \textcite{Bahamonde2018} explains that non-poor individuals can be targeted when they are sufficiently noticeable, increasing compliance. He explains that wealthy houses in very poor neighborhoods in Brazil can be targeted too.


% ``Expected-utility theory has dominated the analysis of decision-making under risk, both as a normative model of rational choice and a descriptive model of how people actually behave. But not all of its predictors appear to be fully consistent with observed behavior'' Levy1992a, 173

% ``Recent years have witnessed increasing dLssatisfaction with expected utility (EU) theory as a descriptive model of choice under uncertainty.'' Battalio1990, 25


% Risk is a central feature of political decision making
% ``Risk is a central feature of political decision making'' \parencite[334]{Vis2011}. 

% For instance, governments might risk political support when pursuing unpopular reforms \parencite{Vis2007,Vis2009,Weyland2002}.\todo{add more} 

% Yet, vote buying is still a very common practice \parencite[F356]{Vicente2014}. For instance, in some countries vote buying is so deeply embedded in electoral politics that \textcite{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012} report that 24\% of registered voters in Nicaragua were offered a clientelist gift. 

% Why do parties keep buying votes? 
% \emph{Why do political parties buy votes?} The core of the answer rests on the idea that clientelist political parties resort to vote buying when anticipating electoral losses \parencite{Diaz-Cayeros2008}. But then, considering that resources aimed at buying votes are scarce, 

% ``The expected-utility principle asserts that individuals attempt to maximize expected utility in their choices between risky options: they weight the utilities of individual outcomes by their probabilities and choose the option with the highest weighted sum''  Levy1992a, 173

% ``The expected-utility principle posits that actors try to maximize their expected by weighting the utility of each possible outcome of a given course of action by the probability of its occurrence, summing over all possible outcomes for each strategy, and selecting that strategy with the highest expected utility.'' Levy1997, 88

% is that parties anticipating electoral losses resort to alternative methods other than delivering policy packages \parencite{Kitschelt2000,Calvo2012a}. 

% Since clientelist political parties operate in uncertain scenarios, the literature has described a few decision-making strategies parties employ, particularly, under contexts of risk. Overall, vote buying requires parties to sustain close relationships over time with their clients in a personal and individualized way \parencite{Auyero2000,Szwarcberg2013,Bahamonde2018}. Unfortunately, parties are left with no more than guesses about whether their clientelistic investments are effective or not. 


% multiplicidad de approaches.
% Instead, the clientelism literature has seen a proliferation of tangential answers. While all of them are contributions, they do not really tackle the afore mentioned question. \textcite{Dixit1996} explain that parties both swing and core voters, but that depends on a number of factors. \todo{add something}. \textcite{Nichter2008} (turnout-buying) is another very important contribution. Unfortunately, it deviates from the question by increasing the complexity on the varieties of clientelism. Similarly


% this paper's contribution
% The paper seeks to contribute to this issue by incorporating both structural and individual factors that foster clientelism in the same theory.

% ``Since its formulation by Kahneman1979, prospect theory has emerged as a leading alternative to expected utility as a theory under risk.'' Levy1992a, 171

% ``Kahneman1979 prospect theory, which provides a descriptive model of decision-making under risk.'' Ackert2006, 5

 % ``In theoretical terms, the S-shaped curve means that people tend to be risk averse in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses; this is the crux of prospect theory. In short, prospect theory predicts that domain affects risk propensity. The third aspect of the value function is the asymmetric nature of the value curve; it is steeper in the domain of losses than in that of gains.'' McDermott1998, 29

% ``[prospect theory] focuses attention on the context of a situation, which helps illuminate other important areas of research, including framing, uncertainty, accountability, escalation and commitment, sunk costs, and momentum effects.'' McDermott2004, 290

% ``In most rational choice models [...] preferences themselves are assumed not to shift. This is not the case in prospect theory, where a decision- maker's risk propensity is expected to shift in response to changes in the environment.'' McDermott2004, 292

% ``Empirical studies of risk taking [...] indicate that risk preference varies with context.'' March1987, 1412

% ``The reference point is a critical concept in assessing gains and losses; thus, it is central to the notions of domain and risk.'' McDermott1998, 40

% ``In prospect theory, value is a function of this change, in a positive or negative direction, rather than a result of absolute welfare, as is the case with subjective expected utility theory.'' McDermott1998, 28

% ``While students of economics and decision theory are implored to concentrate only on incremental costs, it is well established that real decision makers are often influenced by historical or sunk costs''  Thaler1990, 643

% ``We begin by recognizing that most decision makers are influenced by prior outcomes. Our goal then is to investigate how prior gains and losses affect choices.'' Thaler1990, 643

% ``we find that under some circumstances a prior gain can increase subjects' willingness to accept gambles. This finding is labeled the \emph{house money effect'}. In contrast, prior losses can decrease the willingness to take risks. We also find that when decision makers have prior losses, outcomes which offer the opportunity to `break even' are especially attractive.''\footnote{Italics in original.} Thaler1990, 643-644

% ``Our experimental results provide support for a house money effect. Traders' bids, price predictions, and market prices are influenced by the amount of money that is provided prior to trading.'' Ackert2006, 5

% ``An initial loss can cause an increase in risk aversion such that prior losses reduce risk-taking behavior'' Ackert2006, 6

% ``At first consideration Thaler1990's evidence may appear to contradict prospect theory because it suggests risk-seeking behavior after a windfall, whereas prospect theory suggests risk aversion in the domain of gains. However, a house money effect is not inconsistent with prospect theory because prospect theory was developed for one-shot gambles.'' Ackert2006, 6

 % ``Prospect theory is based on psychophysical models, such as those that originally inspired Bernoulli's expected value proposition.'' McDermott1998, 18

% ``Prospect theory posits that individuals evaluate outcomes to deviations from a reference point rather than with respect to net that their identification of this reference point is a critical variable, that they give more weight to losses than to comparable gains, and that they are generally averse with respect to gains and risk-acceptant with respect to losses''  Levy1992a, 171

% ``In the domain of gains [...] the underweighting of probabilities works together with the concavity of the value function to undervalue the gamble relative to the certain outcome, and thus to encourage risk aversion. In the the domain of losses, the underweighting of probabilities [...] reduces the weights given to risky negative prospects [making] them less unattractive, and thus encouraging risk-seeking.'' Levy1992a, 183

% ``Thus the over overweighting (and perhaps the exaggeration) of small probabilities is one possible explanation for the appeal of long-shot gambling, and it also might reinforce the tendency for risk averse individuals to insure against rare but catastrophic losses'' Levy1992a, 184

 % ``prospect theory accounts for these discrepancies by noting the extreme (over)weight and attention that individuals give to small probabilities that potentially involve either huge gains (winning the lottery) or huge losses (losing your house in a fire). This phenomenon helps account for worst-case scenario planning.'' McDermott1998, 32

 % ``Risk-seeking in the domain of losses should led decision-makers to take \emph{disproportionate risks} to avoid certain losses, and risk aversion in the domain of gains should led decision-makers to be \emph{excessively eager} to secure certain gains.''\footnote{My emphases.} Levy1992, 299-300

    % ``people have difficulty with probability at extreme ranges: sometimes people may treat highly likely but uncertain events as certain; on other occasions, people may treat highly unlikely events as impossible.'' McDermott1998, 30

 %``individuals are often willing to tolerate a prospect which is significantly lower in expected value than an alternative in order to avoid a certain loss or secure a certain gain.''  Levy1992, 297


% ``Experimental evidence suggests that people tend to evaluate choices with respect to a reference point, overweight losses relative to comparable gains, engage in risk-averse behavior in choices among gains but risk-acceptant behavior in choices among losses, and respond to probabilities in a nonlinear manner.'' Levy1997, 87


% ``We should say, for example, not that an actor pursued a risky policy because she was in the domain of losses, but that because of risk-seeking with respect to loses she adopted a more risky alternative than predicted by a standard expected-value calculations.'' Levy1992, 298

%% PROBLEMS OF PROSPECT THEORY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% ``Risk is an even more difficult variable to operationalize than domain. The central concern is fear of tautological definition; risk cannot be determined by domain, on the one hand, or by outcome, on the other.'' McDermott1998, 38

%``Prospect theory may appear to be less precise than rational choice theories claim to be, but, in reality, prospect theory proves to be more analytically maleable. This is because, with rational choice theories, utilities are notoriously difficult to assess, and basic supporting axioms are frequently violated in individual behavior.'' McDermott1998, 36

% ``This model failed in predicting outcomes in many instances because it was obvious that the value that a particular payoff held for someone was not always directly related to its precise monetary worth.'' McDermott1998, 15


% ``Prospect theory implies that the magnitudes of the losses need not be that large in order to induce risk-seeking behavior [...] even small losses appear to have significant consequences'' Levy1992, 297

% ``Prospect theory suggests another hypothesis as well: actors perceive themselves to be in the domain of losses more often than we would normally expect'' Levy1992 291  (HERE CITE LAU)

 % ``Loss aversion also helps to explain why states are more concerned to prevent a decline in their reputation or credibility than to increase it by a comparable amount'' Levy1992, 285

% ``One implication of loss aversion is that people tend to value what they have more than comparable things they do not have, and that the disutility of relinquishing a good is greater than the utility of acquiring it.'' Levy1997, 89


% ``the very fact of a loss is often more important than the magnitude of the loss and that large losses may not be that much worse than smaller losses'' Levy1992, 287

% ``A change of reference point alters the preference order for prospects. In particular, the present theory implies that a negative translation of a choice problem, such as arises from imcomplete adaptation to recent losses, increases risk seeking in some situations [...] the tendency to bet on long shots increases in the course of the betting day provides some support for the hypothesis that a failure to adapt to losses or to attain an expected gain induces risk seeking'' \parencite[286-287]{Kahneman1979}

 % As \parencite[297]{Levy1992} explains, the magnitudes of the losses need not be that large in order to induce risk-seeking behavior, even small losses should induce the risk-seeking behavior.

% ``In most economics experiments, subjects receive cash payments that depend on their own choices in the laboratory and, in the case of game-theoretic experiments, on the choices of other people.'' Dickson2011

% ``By controlling for preferences using monetary incentives, experimental economists attempt to focus on testing other aspects of their theoretical models, such as whether actors make choices that are consistent with a model's equilibrium predictions, or the extent to which actors' cognitive skills enable them to make the optimal choices predicted by theory.''

% ``Morton:2010ly summarize existing norms by estimating that payments are typically structured to average around 50 to 100 percent above the minimum wage for the time spent in the lab.

%As \textcite[1405]{March1987} explain, rational agents in the EUT framework, ``when faced with one alternative having a given outcome with certainty, and a second alternative which is a gamble but has the same expected value as the first, [agents] will choose the certain outcome rather than the gamble.''% \footnote{This implies that decision makers should be compensated for taking risky decisions \parencite[1405]{March1987}. Note that the gamble has the \emph{same} expected value (mean) but differs with the certain outcome in its risk (variance).}

% For instance, electoral explanations based on the EUT contend that voters see elections as ``investments'' \parencite{Downs:1957vg,Bassi2011}, a notion that also holds for clientelist political parties under risk \parencite{Diaz-Cayeros2008}. 

% Importantly, it should not matter whether the voter is a swing or a core voter. 
% Importantly, it should not matter whether the voter is a swing or a core voter. Besides risking electoral support from the wealthy \parencite{Weitz-shapiro} or from society in general \parencite{GonzalezOcantos2014}, when clientelist political parties are probable winners, they incur in the additional risk of buying votes from unlikely voters, irregardless of where that voter is in the swing-core continuum. Given the impossibility of accurate monitoring \parencite{Nichter2008,Hicken2020}, in risky contexts parties avoid the (small) probability of losing the election by diversifying their electoral portfolio.
