Why do political parties buy votes? Leveraging on the expected utility theory framework, most quantitative studies about clientelism assert that parties in need of securing electoral victories invest in vote buying. We consider this framework is limited in a number of ways. First, it assumes that loses and gains affect decision-makers in a comparable way---i.e., winning elections feels good as losing one hurts. Second, it assumes that decision-makers focus only on incremental outcomes while overlooking prior outcomes. From a decision-making standpoint whether these assumptions hold is very important for understanding why parties buy votes. By introducing prospect theory in the clientelism literature, we hypothesize that parties are risk averse in the domain of gains and risk-seeking in the domain of loses---i.e., losing an election hurts more than winning an election pleases. This explains why clientelism is most likely when parties are probable winners or have experienced important loses in the past. Unfortunately, the expected utility theory (wrongly) predicts that under these scenarios clientelism should not occur. After formalizing a theory of vote buying and vote selling within the expected utility theory, we tested it in the lab by designing an economic experiment. The voting experiment was carefully designed to capture different domains of gains/losses as well as varying reference points. Exploiting these novel experimental data, we show that prospect theory provides a better explanation of clientelism than does expected-utility theory. As the statistical analyses suggest, because of risk-seeking with respect to loses, experimental subjects adopt a more risky alternative buying votes in a way that is unpredicted by a standard expected-value calculations.
