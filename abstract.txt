Why do political parties buy votes? Leveraging on the expected utility theory, most quantitative studies about clientelism assert that parties in need of securing electoral victories invest in vote buying. Unfortunately, this framework assumes that loses and gains affect decision-makers in a proportional way---i.e., winning elections feels good as losing one hurts. However, from a decision-making standpoint, whether this assumption holds is very important to understand why parties buy votes. By introducing prospect theory in the clientelism literature, we hypothesize that parties are risk averse in the domain of gains and risk-seeking in the domain of loses---i.e., losing an election hurts more than winning an election pleases. This explains why clientelism is most likely when parties are probable winners or have experienced important loses in the past. Importantly, the expected utility theory predicts that under these scenarios clientelism should not occur. After formalizing a theory of vote buying and vote selling within the expected utility theory, we tested it in the lab by designing an economic experiment. The experiment was carefully designed to capture different domains of gains/losses as well as varying reference points. Exploiting these novel experimental data, we show that there exists wide support for the prospect theory. As the statistical analyses suggest, experimental subjects buy votes because their domain shifts from one of gains to one of losses.
