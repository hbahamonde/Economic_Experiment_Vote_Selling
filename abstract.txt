In most developed (and some developing) democracies, clientelism is rather low. While those are good news, the bad news are that we are rather ignorants about a number of other interesting, and yet, unanswered questions. First and foremost, the approach used by most quantitative scholars focuses exclusively on vote-buying. That is, parties offering to buy votes, completely ignoring the ones who sell their votes (i.e. voters). This is a rather important distinction. Would voters still sell their votes to their own party of preference? What are the main factors driving clientelism on the party's side? We developed an experiment within the experimental economics tradition. Exploiting these novel data we shed some light on these questions.
