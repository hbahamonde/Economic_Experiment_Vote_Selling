Why do political parties buy votes? Most quantitative studies about clientelism assert that parties in need of securing electoral victories invest in vote-buying. Since this framework usually focuses on future gains (i.e., winning the next election), we consider it is too narrow as it overlooks past loses, particularly, in contexts of uncertainty. From a decision-making standpoint, this distinction is very important to understand why parties buy votes. By introducing the prospect theory in the study of clientelism, we hypothesize that parties are risk averse in the domain of gains and risk-seeking in the domain of loses. This explains why clientelism happens even when parties are likely winners or have experienced important loses in the past. Importantly, the expected value theory---the most used framework in the literature so far---predicts that in both scenarios clientelism should not occur. After formalizing a theory of vote buying and vote selling within the expected utility theory, we tested it in the lab by designing an economic experiment. The experiment was carefully designed to capture different domains of gains and losses. Exploiting these novel experimental data, we show that there exists wide support for the prospect theory. As the statistical analyses suggest, experimental subjects buy votes because their domain shifts from one of gains to one of losses.
